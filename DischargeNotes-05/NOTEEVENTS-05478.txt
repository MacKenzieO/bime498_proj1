Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 950**] 
Chief Complaint:

episodes of chest tightness.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABGx3 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, SVG->ramus) [**3055-9-17**]

 
History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old white male has a history of CAD and had been 
cathed in [**3050**].  He needed intervention at that time, but was 
waiting for the drug eluting stents.  He has been followed by 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3570**] who felt he needed a new cath as he was having 
increasing chest tightness. He was admitted for the cooling 
study. He reportedly was turned down for a CABG in [**3050**] because 
of obesity.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**3055-9-11**] and was enrolled in the 
cooling study for renal protection during cardiac cath. He had 
an MI by enzymes on admission. He had the catheterization on 
[**9-13**] and it revealed: a 50-60% stenosis of the LAD, 90% diagonal 
lesion, 80% proximal LCX stenosis, and a 90% RCA lesion. His EF 
is 20%. During the cath. he became hypotensive and bradycardic 
and required atropine and dopamine.  He had an IABP placed and 
cardiac surgery was consulted for high risk CABG. He then 
developed ologuric renal failure and responded to high doses of 
lasix.
On [**3055-9-17**] he underwent CABGx3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the 
PDA and ramus.  He was transferred to the CSRU on Epi, Lido, and 
Propofol in stable condition. He had some bleeding on the post 
op night and required 3U PRBC, 2 of platelets, and 1 of cryo.  
He had decreased urine output and was started on a lasix drip 
and natracor.  He continued to require these drips for several 
days and remained intubated until POD#3.  His creat. was between 
3.2 and 4, but he continued to have adequate urine output.  His 
IABP was d/c'd on POD#1.  He slowly improved and was transferred 
to the floor on POD#7.  He developed cellulitis on his L leg and 
has been treated with vanco. He continued to progress and was 
discharged to rehab on POD# 10.

     inferior vena cava, tip in satisfactory position within the right main
     pulmonary artery.  There is upper zone vascular redistribution with perihilar
     haziness and vascular haziness, findings consistent with mild congestive heart
     failure.  The right costophrenic angle is sharp.  The left costophrenic angle
     is excluded from the study.  No focal consolidations are present.  No
     pneumothorax was demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Pre-operative evaluation before CABG in a 70 year old man with
     coronary artery disease, currently on intraaortic balloon pump.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Duplex ultrasonography was performed at the level of
     the cervical portions of the bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries. This
     examination was performed in the ICU, at the patient's bedside.
     
     Duplicated systolic peaks were found, in relation to the intraaortic balloon
     pump. The left central venous line was difficult to visualize.
     
     Mild plaque was found at the origins of the bilateral internal carotid
     arteries, left worse than right. On the right side, the velocities were within
     normal limits, with a peak systolic velocity ratio of 0.52 between the right
     internal and common carotid arteries. On the left side, the peak systolic
     velocities in the internal, common and external carotid arteries were 106, 49
     and 70 cm/sec, respectively, giving a peak systolic velocity ratio of 2.2
     between the left internal and common carotid arteries.
     
     Antegrade flow was found in the right vertebral artery. The intertransverse
     portion of the left vertebral artery could not be visualized.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1) Mild plaque in the proximal portions of the bilateral internal carotid
     arteries, associated with luminal narrowings estimated between 40 and 59% in
     diameter in the left internal carotid artery, and at less than 40% in diameter
     in the right internal carotid artery.
     
     2) Antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery. Left vertebral artery not
     visualized.
