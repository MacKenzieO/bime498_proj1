     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      57 year old woman with severe pulmonary hypertension, severe OSA and CHF.       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Patient with severe pulmonary artery hypertension. Need High resolution Chest 
      CT and CT angiogram to r/o interstitial lung disease and chronic PEs.
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Severe pulmonary hypertension, severe OSA, CHF, ?interstitial
     lung disease and chronic PEs.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT of the neck on [**2750-1-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen before and after administration of 100 cc
     of Optiray contrast.  Non-ionic Optiray contrast was used for rapid bolus
     technique.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are no filling
     defects within the visualized pulmonary artery and its segmental branches to
     suggest pulmonary embolism.  The main pulmonary artery is prominent, measuring
     3.9 cm in its greatest dimension.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels
     are otherwise unremarkable.  There is note of coronary artery calcifications.
     There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions.  There is also adjacent
     compressive atelectasis in the left lower lobe and to a lesser extent in the
     left upper lobe.  The lungs demonstrate a heterogeneous appearance of diffuse
     ground glass opacities which could be secondary to air trapping, fluid
     overload or a mosaic pattern of perfusion which can be seen in pulmonary
     hypertension. Evaluation of the lungs is somewhat limited due to respiratory
     motion.  There are no discrete lung nodules seen.  There are no pathologically
     enlarged axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes.  The airways are patent
     to the segmental level bilaterally.  Extremely limited views of the upper
     abdomen demonstrate no focal abnormalities in the visualized portions of the
     liver. There is note of surgical clips within the left upper quadrant.  Note
     is made that no lesions seen within the visualized portions of the breasts,
     though they are largely out of the field of view.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are innumerable small sclerotic lesions of varying size
     within the visualized axial skeleton.  There is note of several sclerotic
     lesions in the sternum, as well as scattered smaller sclerotic lesions in the
     visualized ribs.  These lesions are new when compared to the visualized upper
     thoracic spine on the patient's prior CT of the neck.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of PE.  Prominence of the pulmonary artery and
     heterogeneous pattern of attenuation in the lungs which may be secondary to
     mosaic perfusion from pulmonary hypertension, air-trapping, or fluid overload
     with accompanying effusions.
                                                                 (Over)

     2) Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis in the
     left lung.
     3) No definite evidence of interstitial lung disease, though exam limited by
     presence of motion artifact and effusions.
     4) Findings which may be consistent with fluid overload.
     5) Interval development of innumerable sclerotic lesions within the bones
     which is highly concerning for diffuse osseous metastasis. The appearance is
     atypical for lymphoma. Correlation with breast exam and mammography is
     suggested.

     incidentally.  She has no known primary cancer.  Please evaluate for
     malignancy.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2746-5-31**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images were obtained from the lung apices to the pubic
     symphysis after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast. Initially
     noncontrast images and early arterial images were performed through the liver.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are bilateral moderate sized pleural
     effusions with associated dependent atelectasis of the lung bases.  There is
     no significant axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is
     atherosclerotic changes within the aortic arch. There is mild cardiomegaly.
     There is prominence of the pulmonary artery compatible with the patient's
     history of pulmonary artery hypertension.  On lung windows, there are no
     pulmonary nodules or masses in the aerated lung.  The mosaic pattern reported
     on the CT scan from two days prior is improved compatible with improving
     pulmonary edema.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The patient has had a
     splenectomy. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals are within normal
     limits.  There is malrotation of the right kidney.  There are two stable
     simple cysts of the left kidney.  There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
     adenopathy.  The bowel loops are unremarkable.  There are two subcutaneous
     lesions which measure approximately 1 cm each and are just deep to the skin.
     These are most likely sebaceous cysts, although metastatic lesions can not be
     excluded.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The uterus and adnexa appear normal.  The urinary
     bladder and pelvic bowel loops are within normal limits. There is no ascites.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate diffuse osteosclerotic lesions throughout the entire
     axial skeleton including the pelvis and femoral necks.  These osteosclerotic
     lesions were not present in [**2745**].

Date of Birth:   [**2693-8-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine, Blumgart Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
female with a history of obesity, severe obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**]
apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic congestive heart
failure who was recently discharged from the hospital on
[**3-9**] who returned for evaluation of persistent nausea and
headache that has been progressive since discharge.

She was admitted on [**3-5**] with hypoxia and started on
[**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure for obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea
in the hospital and discharged on [**3-9**] with home [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure at night.  She reported mild nausea
before discharge but reports progressive symptoms over the
past two weeks not associated with eating.  The patient
states her symptoms seem worse when she was off the [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure machine.  She was also complaining
of a headache that is sometimes associated with nausea but
not always.  She denies any other urinary symptoms.  She
denies gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea,
abdominal pain, or constipation.  She denies any urinary
complaints such a dysuria, frequency, or hematuria.  No chest
pain.  No increase in her lower extremity edema.  No increase
in her baseline shortness of breath.  She states her [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure has not been fitting well, and she
uses it less than three to four hours per night.

In the Emergency Room the patient was noted to be
hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 214.  She was
given 12 mg of Zofran, 2 mg of Ativan, and 4 mg of morphine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Hodgkin's disease; status post radiation therapy and
splenectomy.
 2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
 3.  Obesity.
 4.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction with
an ejection fraction of 70%.
 5.  Hypertension.
 6.  Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea; on home [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure.
 7.  Hiatal hernia.
 8.  Depression.
 9.  Anxiety.
10.  Hypothyroidism.
11.  Chronic facial pain with parotid enlargement.
12.  Degenerative joint disease with severe pain and on
chronic home pain medications.

ALLERGIES:  Her allergies include PENICILLIN and question to
INTRAVENOUS IODINE.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Levoxyl 175 mcg by mouth once per day.
2.  Valsartan 120 mg in the morning and 80 mg in the evening.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once per day.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg twice per day.
5.  Lasix 20 mg once per day.
6.  Prilosec 20 mg once per day.
7.  Ativan as needed (up to 8 mg once per day).
8.  Percocet as needed.
9.  Oxycodone (up to 50 mg once per day).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She quit
tobacco 25 years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Son with congestive heart failure.  Father
and mother with hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her vital signs on
admission revealed a temperature of 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit,
her blood pressure was 153/94 after getting multiple
medications and a systolic blood pressure of 214, her heart
rate was 80, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen
saturation was 88% on 1.5 liters and 96% on 3 liters.  In
general, pleasant and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the sclerae were
anicteric.  The oropharynx was clear.  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  A loud second heart sound.  Lungs revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles.  No
egophony.  The abdomen was obese, soft, ventral hernia, mild
epigastric pain, with some right upper quadrant tenderness.
No guarding.  No rebound.  There were positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema to the low calf.
Distal pulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination was grossly
intact.  She was moving all four extremities with 4+/5
strength throughout.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Chemistry-7
revealed sodium was 142, potassium was 4, notable for a
chloride of 95, bicarbonate was 40, blood urea nitrogen was
10, and her creatinine was 0.5.  Her INR was 1.2.  Calcium
was 10.1.  Her magnesium was 2.1.  Liver function tests were
within normal limits.  Complete blood count revealed her
white blood cell count was 10.7, her hematocrit was 43.3, and
her platelets were 376.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed moderate
bilateral pleural effusions (left greater than right) with
mild congestive heart failure.

An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with normal
axis.  No significant changes compared to [**3-5**].

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was sent to the floor.  On [**3-24**], the patient was
noted to have worsening hypoxia with increasing nausea and
nonbloody and nonbilious vomiting as well as a headache.

On the morning of [**3-24**], the patient became belligerent
with dropping oxygen saturations.  Room air saturation was
87% which improved to 94% on 4 liters.  A half hour later she
was noted to have a desaturation to 63% on 4 liters, and
[**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure was initiated and improved
to 97% on 4 liters and [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure with
settings of 14 and 7.  An arterial blood gas performed on
room air revealed a pH of 737, a PCO2 of 71, and a PAO2 of
34.  Her [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure was increased to 7
liters at that point.

Her Medical Intensive Care Unit course was significant for
diuresis with intravenous Lasix.  The patient received 20 mg
of intravenous Lasix times two over a 2-day period with a
good response.  She diuresed a total of approximately 3
liters while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 48 hours.
The thought was the patient may have developed acute
pulmonary edema secondary to an elevated blood pressure plus
or minus tachycardia.  Her quick resolution, however, would
most likely be consistent with a mucous plug.  However, her
improvement with diuresis would lean more towards a pulmonary
edema picture with her chest x-ray confirming that diagnosis.

The patient was then transferred to the floor after diuresis
and initiation of [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure at night.

1.  OBSTRUCTIVE [**Doctor Last Name **] APNEA ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on overnight [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
with settings of 14 and 7 with 3 liters nasal cannula.  She
tolerated this well for six to eight hours per night and was
encouraged to continue this at home.  The patient has a
follow-up pulmonary studies at the end of this month and will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Pulmonary at that point.

The patient will have mask refitting at home for a more
comfortable device.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient has a
history of diastolic congestive heart failure likely from
long-term hypertension.  She was diuresed well while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  She came to the floor and was switched
to a by mouth regimen of 20 once per day.  The patient's goal
will likely to be to control blood pressure and heart rate
for avoidance of pulmonary edema.  She will be maintained on
her doses of Valsartan 120 in the morning and 80 in the
evening, as well as Lopressor twice per day, and
hydrochlorothiazide.

She was to have a follow-up appointment to evaluate her blood
pressure and current medications.  In addition, the patient
was told to maintain a low-sodium diet and to closely monitor
her weight.

3.  CHRONIC PAIN ISSUES:  Chronic pain issues secondary to
osteoarthritis.  The Pain Service was consulted while the
patient was in house, and given their recommendations it was
difficult to implement secondary to her baseline hypercapnia.
Therefore, we maintained her current regimen of as needed
Percocet.  She was to have a follow-up outpatient visit the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6932**] Management Center.  The patient was to be
maintained on her current dose Percocet and 5 mg to 10 mg of
oxycodone every six hours as needed for her pain.  The
patient and her husband were warned of the signs of
hypercapnia and oversedation.

4.  NEW SCLEROTIC LESION ISSUES:  The patient has a history
of new osteoarthritic/sclerotic lesions consistent with
possible metastatic disease on a computed tomography of the
bad done during her last hospital stay as well as a note of
subcutaneous lesions; likely sebaceous cysts, but metastatic
melanoma could not be ruled out.

Because of these findings, the patient was to have a
follow-up Hematology/Oncology appointment within the next one
to three weeks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was stable on 2 liters nasal cannula (her home dose) with
minimal complaints of pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea.
2.  Diastolic congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Status post Hodgkin's disease with splenectomy and
radiation therapy in [**2738**].
6.  New sclerotic lesions and subcutaneous nodules.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levoxyl 175 mcg by mouth once per day.
2.  Valsartan 120 mg in the morning and 80 mg in the evening.
3.  Percocet 5/325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth
q.6h. as needed.
4.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once per day.
6.  Ativan 1 mg q.6h. as needed (for agitation and anxiety).
7.  Lasix 20 mg once per day.
8.  Prilosec 20 mg once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6933**]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2751-4-13**] for evaluation of her new
lesions.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**2751-4-20**] at 10:15 a.m. for pulmonary function tests
