     RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
        2.9 mCi Tl-201 Thallous Chloride ([**3086-3-23**]);
                  *****************   AMENDED REPORT   *****************
     
     HISTORY: Metastatic melanoma, s/p resection of a metastasis to the left frontal
     lobe. Now with an enlarging nodule at the surgical site and a new mass in the  
     right frontal lobe on MRI. 
      
     INTERPRETATION: SPECT-CT images of the brain were obtained following intravenous
     administration of Tl-201. 
      
     There is a focus of highly intense thallium tracer uptake in the right frontal 
     lobe corresponding to an area of low attenuation on CT, consistent with a 
     metastasis.
      
     There is a focus of moderately intense thallium tracer uptake in the left
     frontal lobe,  corresponding to an area of low attenuation on CT, consistent
     with tumor recurrence. Evidence of left frontal craniotomy is noted. 
      
     IMPRESSION:   1. Focus of highly intense thallium tracer uptake in the right
     frontal lobe, consistent with a metastasis.  2. Focus of moderately intense
     thallium tracer uptake in the left frontal lobe, consistent with tumor
     recurrence.

     INDICATION:  28-year-old male with metastatic melanoma for restaging.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison [**3086-3-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis before and after the administration of intravenous contrast.  Oral
     contrast was administered.  Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and
     reviewed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels
     are unremarkable.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  The central
     bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.
     
     Enlarged subcarinal lymph node is again seen, currently measuring 1.9 x 1.6
     cm, previously 1.8 x 1.6 cm.  Multiple other small mediastinal nodes are
     unchanged, not meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  No significant
     axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.
     
     Lung windows again demonstrate numerous sub 5 mm noncalcified pulmonary
     nodules, none of which are significantly changed from prior exam.  No new
     nodules are seen.  There are no focal consolidations.  Post-surgical change in
     the right lower lobe is seen, relating to prior wedge resection.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Mass in segment VI of the
     liver with surrounding area of increased perfusion is very slightly increased
     in size, currently measuring 40 x 19 mm, previously 37 x 22 mm.  Overall
     appearance is slightly different due to differences in phase of contrast
     bolus, and there is less apparent peripheral enhancement on current study.
     Mild regional intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation related to this mass is
     unchanged.  No new hepatic lesions are seen.  There is no ascites.  The
     gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.
     The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of bowel are normal.  There is no free
     air or free fluid.  No abnormal mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
     is seen.  Eleven-mm node adjacent to the IVC is unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, and pelvic
     loops of bowel are normal.  The urinary bladder and distal ureters are
     unremarkable.  There is no free pelvic fluid or abnormal pelvic or inguinal

     HISTORY:  28-year-old male patient with metastatic melanoma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Brain MRI obtained using multiplanar pre and post-Gadolinium
     images of the brain.  MR spectroscopy images obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  MRI of the brain dated [**3086-2-27**].
     
     FINDINGS:  This brain MRI which the images were submitted for interpretation
     on [**3086-8-27**].
     
     Again seen are the changes from a left frontal craniotomy with blood products.
     Again seen is the hemorrhagic enhancing left frontal lobe lesion which
     demonstrates slight increase in size since the prior study.  The surrounding
     edema is stable since the prior study.  The lesion measures 2 cm in greatest
     dimension. The spectroscopy is inconclusive in this region. No evidence of
     increased flow seen on ASL. It should be noted that a subsequent SPECT
     examination showed tumor in the region.
     
     Again seen is the enhancing lesion with hemorrhage in the medial right frontal
     lobe.  The lesion is slightly increased since the prior study measuring 1.5 cm
     x 1.3 cm.  There is also mild increase in the amount of edema surrounding it.
     ASL demosntrates intense increase in blood flow in the region. Spectroscopy
     shows decrease NAA and increase choline in the region consistent with tumor.
     
     There is no shift of the normally midline structures.  The intracranial flow
     voids are stable.  The ventricular system is within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in size of the right frontal lobe lesion and
     edema.  There is also mild increase in size of the lesion in the left frontal
     lobe. No definite increased perfusion in the region on ASL.

Chief Complaint:
known metastatic melanoma to the brain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left craniotomy

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5618**] is a 29M h/o metastatic melanoma. He underwent 
resection of a left lower eyelid 4.5-mm thick, polypoid melanoma 
in [**3083-7-25**]. In [**3084-2-22**], he developed left neck 
lymphadenopathy with fine-needle aspiration confirming
melanoma. In [**3084-4-23**], he underwent left superficial
parotidectomy and left modified radical neck dissection with
4/76 nodes positive. In [**3084-5-23**], he had a left neck
subcutaneous nodule resected with pathology revealing
melanoma. He underwent radiation therapy and began interferon
with conjunctival an eyelid recurrences, which were
surgically resected. He also underwent resection of a right
lung nodule revealing melanoma. Follow-up CTs revealed
multiple new pulmonary nodules. Screening for high-dose
interleukin-2 revealed a frontal CNS lesion, for which he
underwent craniotomy on [**3085-6-25**] and postop Cyberknife
treatment on [**3085-7-30**]. He began biochemotherapy on
[**3085-8-11**] with torso CT after 2 cycles revealing
decrease in his lung nodules with a stable brain MRI. He
tolerated cycle #3 of biochemotherapy well with the usual
nausea and vomiting noted.

     cortex.  There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.  A
     1.5 cm rounded hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, with mild surrounding
     edema is similar in appearance to known metastatic lesion, better evaluated on
     the recent MRI.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Postoperative changes related to left frontal craniotomy and resection of
     left frontal metastasis.  No evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     2.  Right frontal lobe metastasis, with mild surrounding edema, better
     evaluated on recent MRI examination.

      28 year old man with left frontal brain mass                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please perform wand protocol to evaluate for pre-op planning                    
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Left frontal brain mass.  Wand protocol.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The present study consists of sagittal, axial and coronal post-
     gadolinium images of the brain as well as axial MP-RAGE post-gadolinium
     studies.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  [**3086-3-3**] MR scan of the brain, reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7518**]
     as revealing ""slight interval increase in size of nodularity of left frontal
     lobe lesion.  New right frontal lobe metastatic lesion.""
     
     FINDINGS:  Allowing for the present different scan protocol, the right frontal
     lesion has undergone interval increase in size, now measuring 13 x 17 mm in
     diameter.  The left frontal lesion appears similar in size.  There are no new
     areas of contrast enhancement seen within the brain to suggest additional
     metastatic foci.  There is probable moderate edema surrounding the right
     frontal lesion, similar in extent to that noted on the prior examination.
     Post-surgical changes overlying the left frontal lesion are redemonstrated.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Interval increase in size of the right frontal brain metastasis,
     compared with the prior study.  The lack of pre-contrast T1-weighted scans as
     well as other pulse sequences precludes determination of the extent of
     possible hemorrhagic components within these metastatic lesions at this time.

     CT OF THE TORSO ON [**6-14**]
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma, evaluate progression of disease.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical acquisition of CT images was performed from the lung bases
     to the ischial tuberosities with administration of both oral and 130 cc of
     intravenous nonionic contrast.  Comparison made to prior studies, most recent
     [**3086-4-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CHEST:  Skin staples are seen along the chin from recent nodule excision.
     Within the right lower lobe, there is a small filling defect seen within a
     subsegmental pulmonary vessel, serving the posterior segment of the right
     lower lobe, which is concerning for pulmonary embolus.  Be advised, this study
     is not timed to evaluate for PE, limiting its sensitivity.  Again seen is a
     subcarinal enhancing node or subcarinal lymph node which is unchanged in size
     measuring approximately 18 x 19 mm.  There is an additional epicardial lymph
     node, which has markedly increased in size, previously measuring 8 x 11,
     currently measuring 19 x 13 mm (3, 43).  This is adjacent to a small
     pericardial cyst.  No additional new mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
     lymphadenopathy is seen.
     
     There has been interval development of multiple enlarging pulmonary nodules
     bilaterally, the largest seen in the right lower lobe measuring approximately
     9 x 15 mm, all compatible with progression of metastases.  There is no pleural
     effusion.  Post-surgical changes noted right lower lobe.
     
     ABDOMEN:  Further enlargement of subcutaneous nodule seen within the anterior
     abdominal wall, now measuring approximately 7 mm, previously measured 3 mm (3,
     70).  Furthermore, the segment V and VI enhancing, essentially low attenuation
     hepatic mass has markedly increased in size with geographic appearance which
     is difficult to measure precisely but over 5 cm in AP dimension. Additionally,
     there is regional biliary dilatation within the right hepatic lobe.  No
     discrete new hepatic foci are seen.  Spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
     remain normal in appearance.  There is no significant abdominal
     lymphadenopathy seen.  The bowel loops are normal in appearance.
     
     PELVIS:  Pelvic bowel loops are normal in appearance.  No abnormal
     lymphadenopathy or mass.  Normal appendix seen in the right lower quadrant.

     MR HEAD WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 
     
     HISTORY:  29-year-old man with metastatic melanoma with left frontal
     metastasis, treated with resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, status post
     CyberKnife therapy.  Assess response to radiation, rule out progression or new
     lesions. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images of the head were
     obtained prior to and after the administration of IV gadolinium contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  MR of the head [**3086-4-23**], MR of the head [**3086-4-14**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are post-surgical changes seen in the left frontal lobe
     consistent with prior craniotomy.  There continues to be a left frontal lesion
     that exhibits a rim of hyperintensity on T1-weighted image, with marginal
     enhancement medial to this lesion.  There is also associated enhancement of
     the overlying dura.  There is increased T2/FLAIR signal involving the white
     matter of the left frontal lobe peripheral to this lesion, which likely
     represents edema associated with this lesion.  Compared to prior examination
     from [**3086-4-23**], the overall size of this lesion appears decreased, with a
     decrease in the degree of marginal enhancement, dural enhancement, and
     surrounding edema.  
     
     In addition there is an additional lesion in the right medial frontal lobe.
     This lesion also demonstrates increased T1-weighted signal, with associated
     enhancement.  The size of the enhancing lesion is decreased in size compared
     to prior examination from [**3086-4-23**], measuring 1.3 cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm in
     AP, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions.  The surrounding T2
     hyperintensity has also decreased in size, consistent with resolving
     edema.  There is no significant mass effect associated with these lesions,
     with no evidence of shift of normally midline structures. There are no new
     lesions identified. There is no evidence of acute infarction. There are no
     diffusion abnormalities detected.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There has been interval slight decrease in the size of the left
     frontal lesion, with reduction in the degree of marginal enhancement, dural
     enhancement, and reduction in surrounding edema.  There is moderate decrease
     in the size of the right frontal lesion compared to prior study along with
     moderate reduction in the degree of surrounding edema.  There are no new
     lesions identified on this study.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  28-year-old man with metastatic melanoma; restaging.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3086-6-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis with IV and oral contrast.  Coronal
     and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Pre-existing lesions have increased in size
     and there are many new pulmonary nodules.  For example, a metastasis in the
     apex of the left lung previously measuring 8 mm in diameter now measures 13 mm
     in diameter and a target lesion in the right lower lobe previously measuring
     10 x 14 mm now measures 15 x 22 mm.  A subcarinal node has increased from 18 x
     20 mm to 19 x 23 mm and a pericardiac node on the right has increased in size
     from 16 x 23 mm to 13 x 19 mm.  There is no pleural effusion.  The heart and
     great vessels appear normal and there is no pericardial effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is marked worsening of disease in
     the liver where lesions have become larger and confluent.  For example, a
     metastatic lesion in the right lobe of the liver previously measuring 50 x 53
     mm today measures 87 x 106 mm.  The spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas,
     stomach, and abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear normal.  An
     aortocaval node at the level of the mid pole of the kidneys has increased in
     size from 7 to 9 mm and there are two new mesenteric nodes (3:76) measuring 11
     x 18 mm and 14 mm in diameter.  In the anterior abdominal wall, a subcutaneous
     nodule has increased in size from 6 mm in diameter to 10 mm in diameter and
     another nodule anterior to the spleen and abutting the abdominal wall has
     increased in size from 9 mm to 10 mm in diameter.  There is no free air or
     free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon, bladder and
     distal ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles appear normal.  There is no
     pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.  There is no free air
     or free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.

     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST.  CT OF
     THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST.
     
     INDICATION:  28-year-old man with metastatic melanoma; restaging.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3086-6-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis with IV and oral contrast.  Coronal
     and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Pre-existing lesions have increased in size
     and there are many new pulmonary nodules.  For example, a metastasis in the
     apex of the left lung previously measuring 8 mm in diameter now measures 13 mm
     in diameter and a target lesion in the right lower lobe previously measuring
     10 x 14 mm now measures 15 x 22 mm.  A subcarinal node has increased from 18 x
     20 mm to 19 x 23 mm and a pericardiac node on the right has increased in size
     from 16 x 23 mm to 13 x 19 mm.  There is no pleural effusion.  The heart and
     great vessels appear normal and there is no pericardial effusion.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is marked worsening of disease in
     the liver where lesions have become larger and confluent.  For example, a
     metastatic lesion in the right lobe of the liver previously measuring 50 x 53
     mm today measures 87 x 106 mm.  The spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas,
     stomach, and abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear normal.  An
     aortocaval node at the level of the mid pole of the kidneys has increased in
     size from 7 to 9 mm and there are two new mesenteric nodes (3:76) measuring 11
     x 18 mm and 14 mm in diameter.  In the anterior abdominal wall, a subcutaneous
     nodule has increased in size from 6 mm in diameter to 10 mm in diameter and
     another nodule anterior to the spleen and abutting the abdominal wall has
     increased in size from 9 mm to 10 mm in diameter.  There is no free air or
     free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon, bladder and
     distal ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles appear normal.  There is no
     pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.  There is no free air
     or free fluid within the abdomen.
     
     OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  29-year-old male status post fall from chair.  Patient has known
     metastatic brain lesions.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT head of [**3086-4-14**] and MR head of [**3086-6-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without IV
     contrast administration.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy.  The known
     metastatic lesions in the left and the medial right frontal lobes are not as
     clearly identified on CT as on the recent MR studies; these lesions are
     grossly unchanged, with regions of surrounding edema.  Several punctate
     densities within the left frontal lesion likely represent calcifications
     rather than acute hemorrhage. Ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 116**] of the
     left lateral ventricle is unchanged from the prior CT of [**3086-4-14**].
     
     There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
     structures, hydrocephalus or acute large vascular territorial infarction. No
     fracture is identified.  There is equivocal swelling of the left parietal
     scalp soft tissues.
     
     Small, ill-defined hyperdense foci, measuring 2-3mm in the right paravermian
     cerebellum (2:10), left paramedian centrum semiovale (2:20), and in the left
     frontal lobe (2:16) are not definitely seen on previous studies and are
     concerning for new metastatic lesions, perhaps hemorrhagic (or melanin-
     containing).
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
     2.  Post-operative change related to left frontal craniotomy and resection of
     left frontal lobe metastatis.

     HISTORY:  29-year-old male with left clavicle fracture after fall.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of [**3085-12-3**], and CT torso of [**3086-8-6**].
     
     BEDSIDE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A single frontal chest radiograph labelled ""AP
     upright/grid"" shows a new distal left clavicle fracture with slight
     displacement.  The acromioclavicular joint appears intact.  The bony thoracic
     cage otherwise appears intact.
     
     Lung volumes are decreased compared to [**3085-12-3**], with increased elevation of
     the right hemidiaphragm.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, largely linear in
     appearance, likely represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be
     excluded.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.  The heart size
     remains normal and there is no mediastinal widening.
     
     As on the most recent CT torso of [**3086-8-6**], there are numerous small
     pulmonary nodules, representing known metastatic melanoma; although these
     are less well-demonstrated on the present study, the two largest lesions (at
     the right base and left apex) appear slightly larger.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Left distal clavicle fracture, minimally displaced.  No pneumothorax is
     present.
     2.  Bibasilar patchy opacities, largely linear, likely represent atelectasis;
     however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     3.  Multiple pulmonary nodules in this patient with known metastatic melanoma
     may be slightly larger than on the CT of [**3086-8-6**].
     
     Findings to be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7526**] (primary houseofficer).

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  29-year-old male status post fall from a chair with possible loss of
     consciousness.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior imaging of the cervical spine is available for
     comparison.  Comparison of the craniocervical junction is made with a series
     of CT and MR studies of the head, dated between [**3084-8-18**] and [**3086-6-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial non-contrast images of the cervical spine were
     acquired.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were then obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  C1 through C7 are included on the current study.  A C1
     posterior neural arch congenital fusion anomaly is noted.  The axial images
     show linear lucencies through the left lateral mass of C1, involving the
     anterior cortex and the inferior articulating surface, suspicious for
     nondisplaced and, perhaps, pathologic fracture (2:[**11-4**]). This region is
     incompletely visualized on the numerous prior head CT and MRI studies;
     nevertheless, these lucencies are not seen in the corresponding portion,
     included on those studies. Atlanto-axial joint congruity and alignment are
     preserved. No hematoma or mass is identified in the prevertebral soft tissue
     or within the spinal canal.  No other cervical fracture or acute alignment
     abnormality is detected. Degenerative changes with posterior osteophyte
     formation at C5-C6 and C6-C7 are also present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Focal abnormality of overall density, with linear lucencies
     through the left lateral mass of C1 involving its anterior cortex and the
     inferior articulating surface, not definitely seen on previous studies,
     suspicious for a nondisplaced fracture. The atypical appearance of these
     fracture lines and the irregular appearance of the underlying bone raises the
     question of a pathologic fracture in this patient with known metastatic
     melanoma. Joint congruity and alignment are preserved, and no soft tissue
     hematoma or mass is identified.
     
     An MRI study, including STIR sequences, may provide more sensitive evaluation
     for underlying metastasis and pathologic fracture, if clinically warranted.

     EXAM:  MRI of the cervical spine.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with metastatic melanoma, for further
     evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and inversion recovery sagittal and gradient echo and T2
     axial images of cervical spine acquired.  Correlation was made with the
     cervical spine CT of [**3086-10-27**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The T1 sagittal images demonstrate diffuse low signal within the
     visualized bony structures, which could be secondary to marrow hyperplasia or
     infiltrative process.  In addition, there is increased signal identified
     involving the C1 vertebra with expansion of the left lateral mass consistent
     with bony metastasis.  Increased signal on inversion recovery images is also
     seen involving the most of the cervical vertebral bodies indicating diffuse
     metastatic disease.  In addition, left pedicle and lateral mass of C7, T1, and
     T2 vertebral bodies are also involved with increased signal indicative of
     metastatic disease.
     
     There is no evidence of epidural mass identified.  From C2-3 to C4-5, no disc
     bulge is seen.
     
     At C5-6, there is a left-sided disc herniation identified, which extends to
     the left neural foramen and could result in irritation of left C6 nerve root.
     
     At C6-7 mild bulging identified.
     
     At C7-T1, T1-2, and T2-3, no abnormalities are identified.  The spinal cord
     shows normal intrinsic signal without extrinsic compression.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse bony metastasis involving the cervical vertebrae with also
     involvement of the posterior elements in the lower cervical region.
     2.  Both lateral masses of C1 are involved with the bony metastasis with
     predominant changes and expansion noted in the left lateral mass of C1.
     3.  Left-sided disc herniation at C5-6 level narrowing the foramen, which
     could result in irritation of left C6 nerve root.
     4.  No evidence of intraspinal mass or neoplastic spinal cord compression.

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  29-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, admitted for C1
     spine fracture, now with right-sided chest pain.  Known left clavicle
     fracture.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3086-8-6**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced MDCT acquired axial images of the chest from the
     thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.  Multiplanar reformatted images were
     obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  No filling defect is identified
     within the pulmonary arteries.  The thoracic aorta maintains a normal contour.
     Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.  No pericardial effusion is
     identified.  The lungs demonstrate innumerable metastatic nodules which is
     increased in number and size since last exam. For example, left upper lobe
     nodule (series 3, image 20) measures 16 x 15 cm, previously 13 x 12 cm.
     Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also worsened and the dominant lymph node
     within the subcarinal station now measures 3.7 x 3.2 cm, previously 2.2 x 1.9
     cm.
     
     New air space consolidation/atelectasis is identified within the right lower
     lobe. Postsurgical change is noted in the right lung base. Limited
     visualization of the upper abdomen demonstrate enlarged liver with metastatic
     lesions within the right lobe, increased compared to prior exam as now extends
     to the dome.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Lytic lesions are seen in the left distal second rib, right
     posterior third rib, right T4 vertebral body, left T9 vertebral body and
     lamina, sternum, and bilateral scapula.  Lytic lesion within T9 vertebral body
     has minimal soft tissue component extending into the spinal canal. Innumerable
     metastatic nodules are seen within the soft tissues.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
     
     2.  Diffuse metastatic disease within the lung, liver, osseous structure, and
     soft tissues, increased compared to prior exam from [**3086-8-6**]. Note
     is made of lytic lesion within the T9 vertebral body with small soft tissue
     component extening into the spinal canal and causing mild narrowing.

      29 year old man with chest pain, sats 88-89 on RA, malignancy.                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  A 29-year-old male with chest pain, decreased oxygen saturations and
     known metastatic melanoma.  Evaluate for pneumonia, pneumothorax, evidence of
     PE.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3086-10-27**].
     
     PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ONE VIEW:  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are
     redemonstrated with the largest measuring approx. 1.5 cm in the left lung
     apex.  Given a history of metastatic melanoma, these are concerning for
     metastatic lesions.  There is an opacity in the right lung base, which likely
     reflects atelectasis. However, an underlying associated infectious
     consolidation cannot be excluded. There are also mild atelectatic changes of
     the left lung base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no
     evidence of a pneumothorax.  No clear effusions are seen.
     
     There is a minimally displaced fracture of the left distal clavicle.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1. Opacity of the right lung base, likely represents atelectasis. However
     associated underlying pneumonic consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
     
     2.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, most consistent with metastatic
     disease.
     
     3.  Minimally displaced left distal clavicular fracture.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7526**] at the time of
     interpretation.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      29 year old man with metastatic melanoma, C1 spine fracture and bony mets to 
      cervical spine
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate cervical spine, including C1. Please be sure to obtain axial 
      images.
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI SCAN OF THE CERVICAL SPINE
     
     HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma with the C1 spine fracture and bony metastases
     of the cervical spine.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Only axial T2-weighted images could be obtained, apart from the
     low resolution scout images.  This study was terminated because the patient
     was unable to hold still and at that point, a physician in charge of the
     patient's management terminated the study.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  MR scan of the cervical spine from [**3086-10-28**],
     interpreted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7533**] as revealing ""diffuse bony metastases involving
     the cervical vertebrae with involvement of the posterior elements in the lower
     cervical region.  Both lateral masses of C1 are involved with bony metastases.
     Left-sided disc herniation at C5-6 level narrowing the foramen, which could
     result in irritation of the left C6 nerve root.  No evidence of intraspinal
     mass or neoplastic spinal cord compression"".
     
     FINDINGS:  The present examination, being extremely limited, likely provides
     no new diagnostic information.  Given the extensive motion artifacts and pulse
     sequences employed, it is not surprising that the metastatic disease is
     extremely difficult to portray.  There is a suggestion of possible tumorous
     involvement of the skull base to the left of midline, but clearly the present
     images are not of satisfactory quality to fully confirm this diagnostic
     possibility.
     
     CONCLUSION: Nearly non-diagnostic study, as noted above.
