     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      87 year old woman with CP radiating to back, ruled in for inferior/posterior
      MI, but w/ h/o thoracic aortic aneurysm would like to ensure that it is not
      dissecting.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaluate thoracic aortic aneurysm, last checked at [**Hospital1 15794**] 2 yrs ago, 4 cm
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Chest pain radiating to the back.  History of thoracic aortic
     aneurysm with approximate diameter of 4 cm evaluated on a CT from two years
     ago.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helical scanning of the chest and abdomen was performed after
     administration of 150 cc optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used because of
     the fast bolus injection.
     
     CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST: There are bilateral small pleural effusions, right
     greater than left.  A tiny sub-cm calcified granuloma is present in the right
     middle lobe (series 3, image 23).  There are no other nodules in the
     visualized portions of the lungs.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There is
     mild to moderate cardiomegaly.
     
     The thoracic and abdominal aorta are heavily calcified.  There is a suprarenal
     thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with maximal diameter of 4.3 cm (series 3,
     image 34).  There is partial thrombus within the lumen of the aneurysm.
     There is no intimal flap or second lumen in the aorta.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH CONTRAST: A well defined low attenuation lesion in the
     posterior right hepatic lobe (series 2, image 40) is consistent with a cyst.
     There are no other focal liver lesions.  There is no intra or extrahepatic
     ductal dilatation.  The patient is post cholecystectomy.  No abnormality is
     seen in the pancreas, spleen, adrenals or right kidney.  There is a 5 cm
     simple cyst in the mid region of the left kidney, which is otherwise
     unremarkable.
     
     PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: There is stenosis at the origin of the left renal
     artery (Series 3, image 49) . The kidneys show symmetric nephrograms. No gross
     abnormality is seen in the small bowel.  There are multiple sigmoid
     diverticula, but no evidence of diverticulitis. There is no adenopathy in the
     abdomen.
     The right iliac bone is enlarged and sclerotic, consistent with Paget's
     disease. A tiny amount of free fluid in the pelvis is of uncertain
     significance.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No aortic dissection.  2) The greatest diameter of the
     suprarenal thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm is 4.3 cm.  3) Bilateral small
     pleural effusions.  4) Paget's disease of the right iliac bone.  5) Stenosis
     at the origin of the left renal artery.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: Respiratory distress and mental deterioration. Check ETT
     placement.
     
     FINDINGS: The patient has been intubated. The tip of the ETT reaching the
     carina. Although not definitely obstructing either of the main bronchi it is
     recommended to withdraw the ETT by at least 3 cm. There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication. As before seen on an
     examination performed on the same day earlier marked cardiac
     enlargement and elongation and widening of the calcified thoracic aorta
     exists. Comparison of the pulmonary pattern suggests more advanced
     perivascular haze than before.

     AP portable chest x-ray [**3259-8-8**] at 8:42PM.
     
     HISTORY:  Cardiac disease, status post intubation with perforation of trachea.
      Mental status changes.  Comparison to previous film of earlier on [**3259-8-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube has been advanced, and is now low,
     approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is unchanged with
     the tip in the stomach.  There is interval improvement in subcutaneous
     emphysema with a large amount of residual emphysema.  The heart is enlarged.
     Dense aortic calcifications are seen.  No pneumothorax is identified.
     Evaluation of the lungs is somewhat limited due to the overlying emphysema. No
     significant change from the previous film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Endotracheal tube is slightly low.
     
     2) Some improvement in subcutaneous emphysema.
     
     3) No change in appearance of the lungs.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  CAD, STATUS POST CATHETERIZATION WITH POSSIBLE STROKE AND
     SEIZURES.  ELEVATED INSPIRATORY PRESSURE ON VENTILATOR.  NOW WITH SUBCUTANEOUS
     EMPHYSEMA.  EVALUATE FOR PNEUMOTHORAX.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The ETT with its tip 5 cm above the
     level of carina.  Most striking is the presence of massive subcutaneous
     emphysema bilaterally in the chest walls and most marked also in the soft
     tissue of the neck.  The soft tissue air collection outlines the pattern of
     the chest muscles.  There is no conclusive evidence for significant
     mediastinal air collection nor is there evidence of any pneumothorax.  An NG
     tube is in place and reaches far below the diaphragm where it appears to be
     curled up into the stomach.  Comparison is made with the next previous chest
     examination of [**3259-8-8**] at which time the marked cardiac enlargement
     was noted, but no evidence of subcutaneous soft tissue emphysema existed.  It
     is noted that on the previous examination, the tip of the ETT reach the
     bifurcation level.  There was no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates at
     that time.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Development of subcutaneous emphysema following high pressure
     ventilation.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax nor of a major air
     accumulation within the mediastinum.  The soft tissue pattern is overlying the
     chest, but this does not reflect any new parenchymal infiltrates.

     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T2, T1, susceptibility, FLARE, and diffusion-weighted
     images of the brain were obtained.
     
     HEAD MRI WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. There
     is no midline shift or mass effect. There is increased signal in the
     periventricular white matter on the T2 images consistent with prior small
     vessel ischemic disease. There is also increased signal in the region of the
     left thalamus and genu of the left internal capsule. Again consistent with old
     infarct. In the left cerebellum there is decreased signal in the T1-weighted

     Reason: intubated with small left pneumothorax
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      87 year old woman with CAD, s/p cath with possible stroke/seizure.  Had
      elevated inspiratory pressures on vent now with SQ emphysema, ventilating both
      lungs.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      intubated with small left pneumothorax
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Pneumothorax follow up.
     
     Portable chest: Comparison is made to film from one day earlier. The
     previously noted endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged and in
     satisfactory position. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are grossly
     unchanged, as is the lung parenchyma, allowing for differences in technique
     and positioning.
     
     The left pneumothorax is probably even smaller on today's follow up film.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. ET tube and nasogastric tube in satisfactory position.
     2. The left apical pneumothorax is probably even smaller on today's follow up
     film.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      87 year old woman with CP radiating to back, ruled in for inferior/posterior
      MI, no increasing respiratory demand.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      87 yo woman with increasing respiratory demand after intubation. Suspect
      possible PE, would like CT angio to evaluate for PE.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Increasing respiratory demand and desaturation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the apices with the administration of IV contrast. Multiplanar
     reconstructed images were created.
     
     CONTRAST: 150 cc of Optiray was given. Optiray was used due to the fast bolus
     rate of injection and CAD.
     
     CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a filling defect seen within the
     subsegmental branch of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery. In addition,
     there is a filling defect seen within a segmental branch extending to the
     region of the lingula. There is also a filling defect seen within a
     subsegmental branch to the right lower lobe however this area is somewhat more
     difficult to evaluate secondary to adjacent atelectasis. These are consistent
     with pulmonary emboli. These emboli appear to be new since the examination
     from 4 days prior.
     
     Again seen is a suprarenal thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm measuring
     approximately 4.4 cm in greatest diameter. The aorta is calcified. No
     significantly enlarged nodes are seen within the axilla, hila, or mediastinum.
     A few tiny sub cm nodes are noted in the prevascular region. There are small
     bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of a pericardial effusion.
     
     There is a small left pneumothorax anterior to the heart. There is evidence of
     passive atelectasis associated with the small bilateral pleural effusions.
     There are two small calcified granulomas one in the located in the right upper
     lobe (series 2, image 105) and a second located in the right middle lobe
     (series 2, image 57). There are two areas of patchy opacity seen in the right
     upper lobe (series 2, image 119), and in the right lower lobe (series 2, image
     82). These cannot be characterized further but could represent areas of
     atelectasis, as they were not definitely present on the previous examination.
     
     There is an ET tube present terminating approximately 1.8 cm above the carina.
     There is an NG tube within the stomach however it should be noted that the NG
     tube is coiled within the stomach and the tip points superiorly toward the
     fundus.
     
     There is subcutaneous emphysema seen in the left anterior chest wall.
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     
     In the imaged portions of the upper abdomen, a small 7 mm low attenuation
     lesion is seen in the left lobe of the liver which is too small to
     characterize further, but could represent a hemangioma or a cyst. The
     unenhanced spleen and imaged portion of the right adrenal gland are
     unremarkable.
     
     Degenerative changes are seen within the osseous structures.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructed images again demonstrate
     evidence of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm as well as a pulmonary embolus
     to the left lower lobe although this is better demonstrated on the axial
     images.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Filling defects within the subsegmental arteries in the region
     of the left lower lobe and lingula and within the right lower lobe consistent
     with pulmonary emboli.
     
     2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis.
     
     3. Left anterior pneumothorax.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: Swan-Ganz catheter placement.  Comparison is made to
     previous study from earlier the same day.
     
     A Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed in the interval and terminates in the
     distal right pulmonary artery.  No pneumothorax is identified.  An
     endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position.  A nasogastric tube remains
     coiled in the stomach with distal tip directed cephalad.
     
     The heart is enlarged.  The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  There is
     persistent increased opacity at the right base likely due to a combination of
     pleural fluid and atelectasis.  There is a small left pleural effusion
     present.
     
     IMIPRESSION: 1) Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary
     artery with no evidence of pneumothorax.  2) Small bilateral pleural effusions
     and probable basilar atelectasis.  3) Cardiac enlargement without evidence of
     congestive heart failure.

     Comparison to prior study from [**3259-8-12**].
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is in a somewhat low position,
     terminating approximately 1 cm above the carina.  The right IJ line terminates
     in the lower SVC.  The nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach with the tip
     in the fundus.  Heart size is slightly enlarged, stable.  Thoracic aorta is
     calcified and unfolded.  Pulmonary vasculature appears normal.  Slight hazy
     opacity over the left base likely due to overlying soft tissues, though small
     effusion cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Endotracheal tube terminates in a low position and repositioning is

     HISTORY: 87 year old woman with CAD, history of left pneumothorax status post
     left sided thoracentesis.
     
     Comparison to prior study from [**3259-8-21**].
     
     PORTABLE CHEST: There has been interval decrease in size of left sided pleural
     effusion. A tiny lucency at the left apex may represent a companion shadow of
     the 2nd rib, though a trace apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded. There is
     improved aeration at the left base with some residual streaky opacity likely
     representing atelectasis. The heart size and mediastinal and hilar contours
     are stable with an unfolded, calcified aorta. There is persistent upper zone
     redistribution consistent with mild CHF. Tiny calcified granulomas are again
     seen at the right base, unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Decrease in size of left sided pleural effusion and improved atelectasis
      status post thoracentesis. Question of tiny apical pneumothorax versus rib
     companion shadow; followup radiograph may be helpful.
     
     2. Persistent mild CHF.

     There is generalized demineralization.  No fracture is observed, but the
     shoulder radiograph was only obtained in a single projection.  No definite
     dislocation is identified, but supplemental axillary or traditional Y-view
     would be helpful.
     
     IMPRESSION: Limited examination of the left shoulder due to single projection
     demonstrating no definite evidence of fracture.  If dislocation is of concern
     clinically, additional axillary or Y-view would be recommended.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Rule out stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and T1 axial, and T1 sagittal images of
     the brain were obtained.  Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**3259-8-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is an area of restricted diffusion in the right
     posteroparietal region indicative of an acute infarct.  There is no evidence
     of hemorrhage seen on the susceptibility or T2-weighted images in this region.
      Extensive periventricular white matter changes are again visualized without
     evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  The FLAIR images are
     somewhat limited by motion.
     
     The limited evaluation of the flow voids demonstrates no significant
     abnormalities.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Acute right parietal infarct, new since the previous MRI.  No
     evidence of midline shift or MRI evidence of hemorrhage.  Severe small vessel
     disease in the periventricular region.

     CHEST AP & LATERAL:
     
     HISTORY: S/P left thoracentesis. Evaluate for re-accumulation of fluid in
     patient with increasing respiratory effort.
     
     A moderate sized left pleural effusion is present, which appears partially
     loculated and is increased in size since the recent examination.
     
     The heart is enlarged. There is cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity but
     no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.
     
     There is increasing lung opacification of the left lung base.
     
     Several healed rib fractures are noted. There are also mild compression
     deformities within the thoracic spine of indeterminate age.
     
     On the lateral view, there is probably a small right pleural effusion as well.
     
     IMPRESSION: Moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion which has
     increased in size since the previous study of 1 day earlier. Adjacent
     increased lung opacity likely represents atelectasis associated with effusion
     but an infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

     direction in the region of the expected location of the left hemidiaphragm.
     
     The previously noted left pleural effusion has significantly decreased in size
     with only a small residual effusion remaining. There is probably also a small
     right pleural effusion.
     
     The heart remains enlarged. There is improving atelectasis in the left lower

     A left-sided chest tube remains in place, with an inferomedial course
     terminating in the thoracoabdominal junction area, below the left
     hemidiaphragm contour.  A small amount of pleural fluid is present.  No
     pneumothorax is evident.
     
     The heart and mediastinal contours remain enlarged.  There is slight
     improvement in left retrocardiac opacity.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Persistent small left pleural effusion with single chest tube in place.  No
     pneumothorax.  It is difficult to exclude an infradiaphragmatic location of
     the chest tube on this single projection.
     
     2. Left retrocardiac opacity, slightly improved.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      87 year old woman with above
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      80 yo F with biventricular heart failure and recent CVA now with episodic
      hypotension and increasing lethargy. Please eval for evidence of infarct
      extension or worsening cns edema. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 87-year-old woman with episodic hypotension, increasing lethargy,
     and infarct seen on prior MR.
     
     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
     COMPARISON: Comparison is made with prior CT of the head performed [**3259-8-10**] and
     prior MR of the head performed [**3259-8-23**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without contrast.
     
     CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
     mass lesion, or shift of the normally midline structures.  There is mild
     prominence of the ventricles and sulci, consistent with global brain atrophy.
     There are multiple low-attenuation foci within the periventricular white
     matter, consistent with chronic microvascular disease, not significantly
     changed from prior CT.  Low attenuation is seen within the superior right
     frontal lobe, consistent with a subcortical infarct, not significantly changed
     from prior CT of the head.  No abnormality is seen within the right parietal
     region to correlate with the area of restricted diffusion reported on recent
     MR. (See [**3259-8-23**].)  The orbits, visualized paranasal sinuses, and visualized
     soft tissue and osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular
     territorial infarct.
     
     2. Chronic changes (mild global brain atrophy and periventricular white matter
     disease) and right frontal subcortical infarcts, not significantly changed
     from prior study.  No defect within the right parietal region to correlate
     with area of restricted diffusion on prior MR.
     
     The prior MRI was not available at the time of attending review.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
     
     HISTORY:  History of CAD, pulmonary embolisms, and old left pneumothorax and
     left pleurodesis.  Evaluate for reaccumulation of left pleural fluid.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior study of [**3259-8-29**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Worsening of the left-sided pleural effusion is seen when compared
     to the study of [**3259-8-29**].  There is associated collapse of the left lower lobe
     and lingula.  The right diaphragm is not as sharp as on the prior study and
     suggests there may be a right-sided pleural effusion which is new.  There is
     marked underlying cardiomegaly with possible upper zone redistribution which
     raises the possibility of ventricular heart failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening of the left-sided pleural effusion.
     2.  Small new right-sided effusion may be present.
     3.  Possibility of mild left ventricular heart failure.  Follow-up chest X-ray
     is recommended after further treatment.
