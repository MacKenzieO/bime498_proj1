      79 year old woman with h/o pancreatic ca, s/p whipple in '[**67**], now fevers and
      steatorrhea
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o biliary stricture, pancreatic mass
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  79-year-old woman with history of pancreatic cancer status
     post Whipple in [**3167**].  Now with fevers and steatorrhea.
     
     STUDY:  MRI abdomen, MRCP.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  On a 3 Tesla magnet, multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were
     obtained of the abdomen with focus on the liver, bile ducts, and pancreas.
     This was followed by multiphase gadolinium-enhanced 3 D T1-weighted gradient
     echo images of the upper abdomen from which subtractions were made and
     multiplanar reformats viewed on an independent GE workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:
     The patient has undergone a Whipple procedure with a choledochojejunostomy.  A
     small amount of pancreatic tissue remains within the pancreatic bed with a
     mildly dilated central main pancreatic duct. No pancreatic lesion.  The
     extrahepatic bile duct is mildly dilated measuring up to 8 mm in caliber.  The
     central intrahepatic bile ducts are also mildly dilated with the left ductal
     system slightly more prominent than the right. There is mild irregularity of
     the left intrahepatic bile ducts likely related to cholangitis.  No
     enhancement of the bile ducts to suggest acute cholangitis No mass is seen at
     the choledochoduodenostomy site or stone within the distal extrahepatic bile
     duct.
     
     Within segment II of the liver is a poorly defined multilobulated lesion that
     is mildly hyperintense on T2 and hypointense on T1-weighted images with rim
     enhancement and enhancing septae after gadolinium administration with central
     portions that do not enhance.  This lesion measures 2.7 x 2.6 x 2 cm.
     Surrounding the lesion within the remainder of segment II and the adjacent
     portions of segment [**Doctor First Name **], there is hyperenhancement of the adjacent hepatic
     parenchyma, which is also mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, likely
     reflecting reactive hyperemia. Within the superior portion of the caudate lobe
     bordering on segment II there are also some areas of increased T2 signal that
     show hyperenhancement on post- gadolinium images in arterial, portal venous,
     and equilibrium phases with some central areas of hypoenhancement. These could
     represent early lesions similar to that seen in segment II. Differential
     considerations include hepatic abscess and necrotic metastasis.
     
     The left portal vein is diminutive and tortuous just beyond its origin.  This
     appearance could be secondary to prior occlusion and recanalization.  No
     evidence for acute portal vein thrombus.  No filling defects within the more
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     proximal portal vein or within the SMV to suggest thrombosis either bland or
     septic here.  Portal vein has hepatopetal flow.  The hepatic arteries are
     patent with the left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric artery.
     The right hepatic artery originates from the celiac artery.  There is a focal
     aneurysm of the right hepatic artery roughly 2 cm beyond its origin, with a
     short-segment fusiform aneurysm measuring up to 5 mm in diameter.  The distal
     portion of the right hepatic artery is normal.  The hepatic veins are patent,
     though the left hepatic vein is attenuated within the portion nearest to the
     IVC secondary to the lesions in the left lobe.
     
     There is a large hiatus hernia. No other abnormalities in the vizualized
     bowel. There are multiple small cysts within the kidneys.  Kidneys enhance
     normally and the renal arteries are patent bilaterally.  No hydronephrosis.
     Spleen is normal in appearance. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  No
     lymphadenopathy. There is a small amount of perihepatic ascites.  No
     concerning marrow lesions. There are sacral Tarlov cysts
     
     Multiplanar reformats were essential in the evaluation of the liver lesions,
     bile ducts, and vasculature.
     
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multilobulated lesion within segment II of the liver with peripheral and
     septal enhancement and surrounding hepatic hyperemia.  There is hyperemia as
     well within the superior portion of the caudate lobe with possibly smaller
     lesions here as well.  Differential considerations include hepatic abscess or
     necrotic metastasis.
     
     2.  Mildly dilated extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts with the left
     intrahepatic ducts more dilated and showing slight irregularity suggesting
     prior cholangitis.  No avid enhancement of the bile ducts to suggest active
     cholangitis.  No mass at the choledochojejunal anastomosis or stones within
     the bile duct evident.
     
     3.  Short-segment right hepatic artery fusiform aneurysm measuring up to 5 mm.
     The left hepatic artery originates from the left gastric artery.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  79-year-old woman with history of pancreatic cancer status post
     Whipple.  Now with fever, weight loss, and fatigue.  New liver lesion on MRI.
     For core biopsy.
     
     COMPARISON:  MR of the abdomen [**3177-9-26**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Limited initial ultrasound examination of the liver demonstrates a
     4.2 x 3.3 cm hypoechoic mass in the left lobe of the liver, within segment II,
     as seen on the recent MRI.
     
     Written informed consent was obtained from the patient after the patient's
     questions were answered.  A preprocedure timeout checklist confirmed patient
     identity and site and type of procedure.  Under sterile technique, with
     ultrasound guidance, an initial 18-gauge aspirate of the center of the lesion
     was obtained, resulting in approximately 1 cc of bloody fluid.  Following
     this, two 18-gauge core biopsy samples were obtained.  Onsite pathology
     confirmed adequacy of sample.  The patient received intravenous conscious
     sedation under continuous cardiac monitoring by the radiology nurse.  Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2171**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 311**], attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] present and supervising.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well, without apparent complication.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically successful aspiration for microbiology and core
     biopsy of liver mass.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a moderately large pneumothorax
     in the left hemithorax. The scout view shows that there is still a chest tube.
     There are also atelectatic changes of the left lower lobe.  On the right side,
     there is compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe, and probably the
     right middle lobe as well, to some extent, associated with a moderate pleural
     effusion.
     
     There is a jejunostomy tube, and two surgical drains terminating in the dome
     of the liver.  The patient is status post left lobectomy.  There is some gas-
     fluid and enhancement in the resection bed, wall, which may represent
     postoperative change, although in the presence of infectious symptoms, an
     abscess cannot be excluded by imaging. The presence of gas most likely relates
     to the presence of the drains.  This region measures 2.2 mm in diameter.
     Overlying subcutaneous air is also noted.
     
     There is small amount of ascites surrounding the tip of the liver, inferiorly.
     A small cystic lesion in the right lobe of 9 mm in diameter is likely a cyst,
     and showed no enhancement on a prior MR [**First Name (Titles) 2026**] [**3177-9-10**].
     
     The patient is status post Whipple procedure as well.  There is no evidence of
     obstruction of either limb, and the post-operative appearance of the small
     bowel is unremarkable.  The remaining pancreas appears atrophic. There is a
     large hiatal hernia. The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal.  There are
     two sub-5 mm hypoattenuating foci in the right kidney, which are too small to
     characterize but may represent cysts. The right kidney is slightly smaller
     than the left.
     
     There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  However, there are multiple
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     lymph nodes within the mesentery, particularly in the left upper quadrant. The
     largest measures 17 x 11 mm in axial dimensions. Slightly prominent lymph
     nodes are also present adjacent to the cecum and througout the abdomen.  In
     the neighborhood of the cecum, surgical clips are present as well.  There is
     also non-specific increased attenuation of the mesenteric fat, which can be
     post-surgical. There is no free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
     bladder, which contains air.  The uterus, adnexal regions, sigmoid, and rectum
     are within normal limits.  There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy, or
     free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  There are
     old prior healed fractures of the right inferior pubic ramus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Persistent moderately large pneumothorax, in spite of the presence of the
     chest tube.
     
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, including hydropneumothorax on the left side.
     
     3.  Right lower lobe, and probably right middle lobe compresive atelectasis.
     
     4.  Postoperative appearance status post left liver lobectomy, and prior
     Whipple, with drains in the right upper quadrant.
     
     5.  Small collection of fluid and gas in the resection bed, measuring 22 mm in
     diameter.  The presence of the drain likely accounts for the persistence of
     air, although an infectious etiology cannot be excluded by imaging.
     
     6.  Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes throughout the abdomen.  These
     are as large as 11 mm in shortest axis dimension and are quite prominent.
     
     7.  Large hiatal hernia.
     
     The presence of the persistent pneumothorax was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13064**]
     shortly following this study.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      79 yo with j-tube in place for tube feeds. tube now clogged. needs to be
      unclogged or exchanged per dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Feeding requiring a jejunostomy (J) tube, which is now clogged.
     Please unclogged J-tube.
     
     PHYSICIANS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 124**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) 295**]
     (the attending radiologist) present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The jejunostomy tube was identified in the mid
     abdomen. A fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm its presence within the
     abdomen. Contrast could not pass through the tube as the tube was clogged.
     Fluoroscopic guidance was used to advance a Glidewire through the tube into
     the jejunum. Proper intrajejunal position of the tube tip was confirmed by
     injection of contrast into the jejunostomy tube as demonstrated by a
     fluoroscopic image, with no contrast extravasation detectable. Approximately
     50 cc of Optiray 320 was used in total. The tube was then flushed with normal
     saline.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful fluoroscopically guided unclogging of jejunostomy tube,
     which remains in place, and is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Feeding requiring a jejunostomy (J) tube, which is now clogged.
     Please unclogged J-tube.
     
     PHYSICIANS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 124**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) 295**]
     (the attending radiologist) present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The jejunostomy tube was identified in the mid
     abdomen. A fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm its presence within the
     abdomen. Contrast could not pass through the tube as the tube was clogged.
     Fluoroscopic guidance was used to advance a Glidewire through the tube into
     the jejunum. Proper intrajejunal position of the tube tip was confirmed by
     injection of contrast into the jejunostomy tube as demonstrated by a
     fluoroscopic image, with no contrast extravasation detectable. Approximately
     50 cc of Optiray 320 was used in total. The tube was then flushed with normal
     saline.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful fluoroscopically guided unclogging of jejunostomy tube,
     which remains in place, and is ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Status post left hepatic lobectomy and Whipple's procedure with
     confusion, fevers, altered mental status, and seizure activity.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from [**3177-11-29**] and [**3177-12-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the
     pubic symphysis were acquired following the administration of 150 cc IV
     Optiray and enteric contrast administered through the patient's existing
     jejunostomy tube.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to protocol.
     Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated is a large right
     pleural effusion and moderate-sized left pleural effusion, both of which have
     minimally increased in size since the prior examination.  There is continued
     compressive atelectasis of both lower lobes.  Additionally, there is a stable-
     appearing 4-mm ground-glass nodule in the periphery of the right middle lobe,
     which is unchanged in the interval.  A large axial hiatal hernia is again
     noted, unchanged in the interval.  There is no pericardial effusion.
     
     The patient is status post left hepatic lobectomy and Whipple's procedure.
     Again adjacent to the surgical drain within the resection bed is a
     heterogeneous low-attenuation collection with resolution of the previously
     identified air bubbles in this area.  The collection measures approximately
     3.5 x 2.5 cm, and is stable in size since the prior examinations.  No new
     focal fluid collections are identified within the abdomen.  Again demonstrated
     within the periphery of segment V of the liver is a 6-mm low-attenuation
     lesion, which is stable in the interval.  No new hepatic lesions are otherwise
     identified.  There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation seen.
     
     The spleen, adrenal glands, right kidney, stomach, and loops of large and
     small bowel appear unremarkable.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction or
     bowel wall thickening.  Again seen within the interpolar region of the right
     kidney are two, subcentimeter hypodensities noted, unchanged in the interval,
     and too small to fully characterize.  Both kidneys enhance symmetrically and
     excrete normally.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The body and tail of the
                                                                 (Over)

     pancreas are atrophic.  Atherosclerotic disease is demonstrated throughout the
     abdominal aorta, but no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation is present.  The
     portal vein is patent.  There is no evidence of free air or free fluid.  A
     jejunostomy tube is demonstrated in unchanged position.  Again noted are
     multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, which are not significantly changed
     in the interval. Previously identified diffuse mesenteric stranding has
     improved in the interval, but still persists.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Large amount of fluid and fecal
     material is demonstrated within the sigmoid and rectum which are distended.
     Pelvic loops of bowel otherwise appear unremarkable without evidence of
     obstruction. Distal ureters, bladder are within normal limits.  The uterus is
     heterogeneous in appearance and likely is reflective of a fibroid uterus.
     There is no free fluid.  No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  A chronic fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus is again
     demonstrated.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     confirming the above findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Heterogeneous low-attenuation collection within the resection site
     adjacent to the hepatic surgical drain with interval resolution of the
     previously identified gas bubbles in the collection.  The collection is stable
     in size. This likely represent a chronic postsurgical fluid collection,
     however, a superimposed infection within this collection cannot be fully
     excluded on imaging criteria alone.
     
     2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, which appear
     minimally increased in size since the prior study.  There is compressive
     bibasilar atelectasis.
     
     3.  Large axial hiatal hernia.
     
     4.  Interval improvement in diffuse mesenteric stranding.
     
     5.  Large amount of fecal material and liquid within the rectum and sigmoid
     colon.
     
     6.  Multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, which are relatively stable
     since the prior exam.
     
     7.  No new focal fluid collections identified within the abdomen.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  79-year-old woman with left hepatic lobectomy on [**11-7**],
     recent CT scan showing gallbladder fossa fluid collection.  Followup.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of oral and IV contrast
     using the general technique.  Multiplanar reformats were also obtained.  This
     study was compared to [**3178-2-11**] CT scan.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The previously identified right middle lobe
     nodule is not seen on this study and may be above the field of the view. There
     are large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
     associated compressive atelectasis. These are similar in size to the previous
     examination.  No pericardial effusion is seen. There is a large hiatal hernia.
     
     Post whipple changes with a choledochojejunostomy.  The patient is status post
     left hepatectomy; a surgical drain is seen from the superior aspect of the
     liver, through the porta hepatis, and exiting the right lower quadrant.  9 mm
     low density right lobe lesion was seen to be a cyst on MRI of [**3177-9-26**].
     A small fluid collection is seen around the surgical drain at the porta
     hepatis measuring approximately 24 x 37 mm, not significantly changed since
     the last examination.  Central biliary ductal dilatation is slightly increased
     in the interim.  A jejunostomy tube is seen in the midline entering jejunal
     loops, which accounts for the lack of oral contrast in the stomach and
     proximal bowel loops.
     
     Bilateral low density renal lesions are not changed. Spleen, adrenals,
     pancreas, aorta, and its major branches, are not significantly changed.  No
     new fluid collections are seen. There is no free air in the abdomen.  There is
     mild diffuse mesenteric stranding, which is unchanged since previous.
     Mesenteric lymph nodes are also identified, not significantly changed since
     the last examination.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A large air-feces-fluid level is seen in the
     rectum.  Otherwise, bowel loops are within normal limits.  There is no
     evidence of obstruction.  Bladder and distal ureters are within normal limits.
     The uterus is somewhat heterogenous in appearance, which may reflect vascular
     calcifications, but unchanged from previous.  No free fluid or free air is
                                                                 (Over)

     PROCEDURE:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the
     Attending Radiologist, being present and supervising throughout.  The left
     upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  As no

     vein. Hard copy ultrasound images were printed to document venous patency
     before and after catheter placement.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle was used to access the left brachial vein, and under
     fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018 guide wire was advanced with its tip placed in
     the SVC. Over an introducer sheath, a single- lumen PICC trimmed to 35 cm was
     advanced with its tip placed in the distal SVC.  A final fluoroscopic spot
     image was saved to confirm tip placement.  The PICC was flushed, heplocked,

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      79 year old woman with fluid collection around JP(original drain since [**10-15**]) 
      s/p liver resection [**10-15**] for chronic inflammatory granulomatous changes now 
      with low grade fevers/mental status changes
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please down size JP/place smaller drain and do alcohol embolization of tract 
      with attempt to drain fluid collection around JP drain.Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**] 
      when procedure being done

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  79-year-old woman with fluid collection around JP
     drainage catheter, status post liver resection, low-grade fever and mental
     status change.  Now needs to downsize the JP drainage catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient and patient's
     family, verbal consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the
     patient's name, procedure, and the site.  The right abdomen and preexisting JP
     drainage catheter were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  10
     cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local anesthesia.  After the drainage
     catheter was cut down, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was used to access through
     the preexisting catheter with the tip in the fluid collection around the JP
     drainage catheter.  The catheter was removed.  A 7-French bright-tip sheath
     was placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected through the sheath and
     venogram was performed.  There is a direct communication between small bowel
     loop and the fluid collection.  The intrahepatic biliary tract was not
     dilated.  The hepatojejunal anastomosis is unremarkable.
     
     Based on the diagnostic findings, the decision was made that the 10-French
     multipurpose drainage catheter placement would be helpful for the patient. 
     Therefore, the sheath was removed.  A 10-French multipurpose pigtail drainage
     catheter was placed over the wire with the pigtail locked in the fluid
     collection.  No tract embolization was performed during the procedure.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
     complications.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      79 year old woman with fluid collection and pigtail drain that has stopped
      draining as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**].
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pigtail upsized on [**3178-2-21**] and now not draining.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Potential biliary cutaneous fistula with drain, assess for continued
     drain necessity.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, a sinogram was
     performed through the current drain.  This demonstrated a contained pocket
     about 3 x 3 cm in size surrounding the pigtail of the previously placed
     10-French pigtail drainage catheter.  Again appreciated was a moderate-sized
     communication of this area with the afferent limb resulting from patient's
     prior Whipple procedure.
     
     Initially the drain was difficult to inject, suggesting a drain occlusion and
     thus the reason why there was no drainage.  This, combined with lack of
     increase in size of surrounding Cavity, suggests the cavity is well contained
     and unable to expand.  Hence, the pigtail catheter was removed after which an
     8-French vanSonnenberg catheter was placed, the catheter placed solely within
     the tract with its locking tip rather than within the cavity.  The tip is
     mushroom shaped and contains a single oversized drainage port bigger than the
     side holes of a 10-French catheter.
     
     If the current scenario remains stable over time (approximately 3 weeks),
     re-consideration for catheter removal and tract embolization will be carried
     out.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Persistent communication of a well contained cavity with the afferent limb
     in this patient status post Whipple procedure.  Current 10-French pigtail
     catheter was exchanged for an 8-French vanSonnenberg catheter with a single
     oversized hole and placed within the tract.  Hopes are for cavity and catheter
     removal and tract embolization.

      79 year old woman with fluid collection and pigtail drain that has stopped
      draining as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**].
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pigtail upsized on [**3178-2-21**] and now not draining.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Potential biliary cutaneous fistula with drain, assess for continued
     drain necessity.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, a sinogram was
     performed through the current drain.  This demonstrated a contained pocket
     about 3 x 3 cm in size surrounding the pigtail of the previously placed
     10-French pigtail drainage catheter.  Again appreciated was a moderate-sized
     communication of this area with the afferent limb resulting from patient's
     prior Whipple procedure.
     
     Initially the drain was difficult to inject, suggesting a drain occlusion and
     thus the reason why there was no drainage.  This, combined with lack of
     increase in size of surrounding Cavity, suggests the cavity is well contained
     and unable to expand.  Hence, the pigtail catheter was removed after which an
     8-French vanSonnenberg catheter was placed, the catheter placed solely within
     the tract with its locking tip rather than within the cavity.  The tip is
     mushroom shaped and contains a single oversized drainage port bigger than the
     side holes of a 10-French catheter.
     
     If the current scenario remains stable over time (approximately 3 weeks),
     re-consideration for catheter removal and tract embolization will be carried
     out.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Persistent communication of a well contained cavity with the afferent limb
     in this patient status post Whipple procedure.  Current 10-French pigtail
     catheter was exchanged for an 8-French vanSonnenberg catheter with a single
     oversized hole and placed within the tract.  Hopes are for cavity and catheter
     removal and tract embolization.

     INDICATION:  79-year-old woman status post left hepatic lobectomy and status
     post Whipple, now with fevers.
     
     COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to the CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2-18**], 2006.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning was performed of the abdomen and pelvis
     after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformations were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  The large right pleural effusion persists, but there has been
     improvement in the left pleural effusion.  The visualized heart and
     pericardium appear unremarkable.  A large hiatal hernia is again seen.
     
     The patient is status post left hepatectomy.  Again seen is a simple cyst in
     the right lobe of the liver anteriorly.  The patient is status post Whipple
     procedure.  In the region of the hepaticojejunostomy a catheter is seen
     terminating within a fluid collection now measuring 2.9 x 1.5 cm as compared
     to the prior study in which it measured 3.7 x 2.4 cm.  This fluid collection
     is in continuity with the afferent limb.  No new fluid collections are
     identified in this region or in the remainder of the abdomen.  A J-tube is
     again seen entering the efferent loop.
     
     The spleen and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The kidneys enhance and
     excrete contrast symmetrically, and multiple round hypodensities are again
     seen within both consistent with simple cysts.  The pancreatic body and tail
     are atrophic.  Mild mesenteric stranding is stable since the prior study.  No
     free air is seen within the abdomen.  Borderline mesenteric lymph nodes are
     stable since the prior study.  There is no evidence of bowel dilation.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS:  The bladder and uterus appear unremarkable.  Large amount
     of stool is again seen within the rectum.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic
     or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.  There is no free fluid within the
     pelvis.  Again seen is a single surgical clip in the right lower quadrant.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate a healed fracture of the right inferior pubic ramus.
     Mild degenerative changes are seen of the spine.
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  80-year-old woman with enterocutaneous fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 333**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 124**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 128**] was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The abdomen was prepped and draped sterilely and
     the preprocedure timeout was performed.  A scout fluoroscopic view
     demonstrated the jejunostomy tube in the region of the small bowel and a
     mushroom type drainage catheter in the right upper quadrant.
     
     A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced into the J-tube which was exchanged over the
     wire for a 14-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 13074**] feeding jejunostomy, under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 silk and sterile
     dressing. Contrast was injected into the jejunostomy confirming its position
     within the nondilated bowel demonstrating normal peristalsis.
     
     Contrast was then injected into the other catheter in the right upper
     quadrant, the mushroom tip drainage catheter. The sinogram demonstrated
     passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavitary space which
     was demonstrated on the previous sinogram. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced
     into the catheter and the catheter was exchanged over the wire for an 8-French
     angiographic bright tip introducer sheath.  The sinogram was then performed
     while retracting the sheath. It demonstrated a thin narrow fistulous tract and
     free passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavity outside of
     the bowel.  There was late filling of bile ducts, probably related to reflux
     from bowel. In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**], the decision was made to embolize
     the fistulous tract using Gelfoam material. Several large Gelfoam torpedos
     were deployed into the fistulous tract throughout its extent via the
     introducer sheath.  The sheath was then removed. No residual leakage was

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  80-year-old woman with enterocutaneous fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 333**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 124**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 128**] was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The abdomen was prepped and draped sterilely and
     the preprocedure timeout was performed.  A scout fluoroscopic view
     demonstrated the jejunostomy tube in the region of the small bowel and a
     mushroom type drainage catheter in the right upper quadrant.
     
     A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced into the J-tube which was exchanged over the
     wire for a 14-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 13074**] feeding jejunostomy, under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 silk and sterile
     dressing. Contrast was injected into the jejunostomy confirming its position
     within the nondilated bowel demonstrating normal peristalsis.
     
     Contrast was then injected into the other catheter in the right upper
     quadrant, the mushroom tip drainage catheter. The sinogram demonstrated
     passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavitary space which
     was demonstrated on the previous sinogram. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced
     into the catheter and the catheter was exchanged over the wire for an 8-French
     angiographic bright tip introducer sheath.  The sinogram was then performed
     while retracting the sheath. It demonstrated a thin narrow fistulous tract and
     free passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavity outside of
     the bowel.  There was late filling of bile ducts, probably related to reflux
     from bowel. In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**], the decision was made to embolize
     the fistulous tract using Gelfoam material. Several large Gelfoam torpedos
     were deployed into the fistulous tract throughout its extent via the
     introducer sheath.  The sheath was then removed. No residual leakage was

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old woman with biliary fistula, drainage from around cath site
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      79yo with h/o hepatic resection for abcess with catheter in biliary cutaneous
      fistula. Now with 24hr h/o increased drainage from around cath site. Please do
      cath check, assess positioning of tube, assess for fluid collection and
      reposition tube if needed.
      PLEASE PAGE DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] DURING PROCEDURE P. 39288
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  80-year-old woman with enterocutaneous fistula.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 333**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 124**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 128**] was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was appropriately consented and placed supine
     on the angiographic table.  The abdomen was prepped and draped sterilely and
     the preprocedure timeout was performed.  A scout fluoroscopic view
     demonstrated the jejunostomy tube in the region of the small bowel and a
     mushroom type drainage catheter in the right upper quadrant.
     
     A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced into the J-tube which was exchanged over the
     wire for a 14-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 13074**] feeding jejunostomy, under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 silk and sterile
     dressing. Contrast was injected into the jejunostomy confirming its position
     within the nondilated bowel demonstrating normal peristalsis.
     
     Contrast was then injected into the other catheter in the right upper
     quadrant, the mushroom tip drainage catheter. The sinogram demonstrated
     passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavitary space which
     was demonstrated on the previous sinogram. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced
     into the catheter and the catheter was exchanged over the wire for an 8-French
     angiographic bright tip introducer sheath.  The sinogram was then performed
     while retracting the sheath. It demonstrated a thin narrow fistulous tract and
     free passage of contrast into the bowel with no appreciable cavity outside of
     the bowel.  There was late filling of bile ducts, probably related to reflux
     from bowel. In consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 342**], the decision was made to embolize
     the fistulous tract using Gelfoam material. Several large Gelfoam torpedos
     were deployed into the fistulous tract throughout its extent via the
     introducer sheath.  The sheath was then removed. No residual leakage was
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated. Sterile dressing was applied.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  The jejunostomy was replaced for a new Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 13074**] jejunostomy tube with
     an interlocking loop formed within the jejunum.
     
     2.  Sinogram demonstrated near complete obliteration of the cavity outside of
     the bowel and persistent enterocutaneous fistula with narrow lumen.
     
     3.  Embolization of the cutaneous fistula with Gelfoam torpedoes with no
     residual leakage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  SOB, tachypnea, status post right thoracentesis, evaluate
     for pneumothorax.
     
     Comparison with the prior chest x-ray shows a marked reduction in the size of
     the right pleural effusion.  Only slight lateral blunting is present.
     
     No pneumothorax is seen in the right lower zone.  A line is present in the
     outer third which probably represents an under-expanded right middle lobe. 
     Lung markings are seen lateral to it, and I think it probably does not
     represent evidence of a significant pneumothorax.
     
     Atelectasis in the left lower lobe is seen.  Left effusion is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant pneumothorax.
