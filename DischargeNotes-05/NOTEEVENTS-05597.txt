""The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global 
left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior 
and inferolateral walls. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic 
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Right ventricular cavity size and systolic 
function are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but not stenotic. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least 
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of

[**2948-10-17**] Cardiac Catheterization:
""INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: 
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class , unstable. Prior 
PTCA
[**2945**]. Drop in echocardiolographic ejection fraction in the 
setting of
elevated cardiac troponin levels.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right-sided filling pressure.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD.
COMMENTS: 
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant 
system
with three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had a 40% ostial 
stenosis
with damping. The LAD had a hazy ostial 70% stenosis, 50% mid, 
and 60%
mid to distal lesions. The LCX artery had diffuse 40% proximal 
and 95%
OM2 lesions. The RCA had 50%, 50% RCA, 50% mid to distal, 60% 
distal,
and 80% diffusely diseased PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided 
filling
pressures (PCWP mean 28 mmHg), borderline pulmonary hypertension 
(PA
mean 40 mmHg)
3. Left ventriculography deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial LAD with a 2.5 mm 
Cypher
drug-eluting stent, which was post-dilated to 3.0 mm.""

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67yo female with CAD s/p MI, DMII with ESRD presents with 
acute onset SOB after dialysis who ruled in for NSTEMI with CK 
peak of 207 and troponin peak of 2.22.

SOB: The patient received a portable Echo in the MICU which 
showed new changes with ""moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral 
walls"" and an EF of 30%.  The patient was brought to the cath 
lab on [**2948-10-18**] where the patient was shown to have three vessel 
coronary artery disease with elevated right-sided filling 
pressure.  The patient subsequently underwent successful 
stenting of the LAD and was brought to the floor.  On the floor, 
the patient was monitored on telemetry for 48 hours without 
incident.  The patient was without complaints and 
hemodynamically stable on discharge to the care of the son where 
she will live with the support of the daughter in law.

ESRD: The patient received HD according to her regular schedule 
of T, Th and S.

DM: The patient was maintained on her home regimen while on the 
floor.  This was not an active issue.
