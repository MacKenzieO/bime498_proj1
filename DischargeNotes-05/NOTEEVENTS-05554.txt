     CT CHEST HIGH RESOLUTION CT DATED  [**2838-9-24**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Productive cough.  Afebrile on steroid therapy. Question
     COP versus pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT neck [**2838-4-27**] and a chest radiograph of [**2838-9-20**] and
     [**2838-9-2**].  Additional clinical information provided on the chest radiographs
     is multiple myeloma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the chest was performed using contiguous
     helical and noncontiguous high resolution axial CT techniques.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are new relatively geographically marginated ground glass and
     reticular opacities at the right apex, possibly due to post-radiation changes.
     There is bronchial wall thickening and mild bronchial dilation, predominantly
     in the lower lobes.  Mild bronchial dilation is also seen within the middle
     lobe and lingula.  Within the right upper lobe, there are a few areas of
     secretions within subsegmental airways.  Within the lower lobes, there are
     centrilobular branching opacities consistent with impaction of small airways,
     particularly in the dependent portions of the lung bases.  No obstructing
     central airway abnormalities are identified.
     
     A 2-3 mm diameter small noncalcified lung nodule is present in the right upper
     lobe anteriorly (image 93, series 8).  An additional poorly defined nodule was
     present in the right upper lobe at a lower level measuring just below 5 mm in
     diameter near the minor fissure (image 70, series 8), and a similar size
     nodule is present in the medial segment right middle lobe (image 59 of series
     8).
     
     There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement.  The main pulmonary
     artery is enlarged at 3.5 cm in diameter.  Diffuse coronary artery
     calcifications are present.  The heart size is normal, and there is no
     pericardial or pleural effusion.  A chest wall mass is present destroying
     portions of the left eighth posterior rib, measuring about 3 cm x 1.9 cm in
     diameter (image 59, series 7).
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal glands are normal.
     Diffuse vascular calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and its
     branches.  No suspicious abnormalities are identified within the liver on this
     unenhanced CT, which was not specifically tailored for evaluating the
     abdominal organs.
                                                                 (Over)

     Skeletal structures reveal a healing displaced fracture of the medial aspect
     of the right clavicle with associated periosteal reaction.  As noted, there is
     a destructive lesion involving the left eighth lateral rib, also reported on
     multiple chest radiographs.  Deformities of the ninth posterior ribs
     bilaterally also suggest healed fractures, also noted at multiple additional
     rib levels.  Scattered lucent skeletal lesions are seen throughout the imaged
     vertebral structures, including ribs, vertebrae, and the right scapula. Within
     the T11 level, there is an area of osseous destruction posteriorly which
     extends to the region of the spinal canal, but it is difficult to determine
     whether there is any soft tissue component extending into this region.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Evolving radiation fibrosis right apex, status post radiation therapy to a
     pathological fracture of the medial right clavicle.
     
     2.  Bronchial wall thickening, mild bronchial dilation and small airways
     disease within the dependent portions of the lower lobes.  Infectious small
     airways disease or chronic aspiration should be considered.
     
     3.  Diffuse skeletal involvement by multiple myeloma.  Destruction of
     posterior aspect of the vertebral body at approximately T11, for which it is
     difficult to evaluate for spinal canal involvement on routine CT. Spine MR
     could be obtained for more complete assessment if warranted clinically.
     
     4.  Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.

     MR THORACIC SPINE
     
     HISTORY:  62-year-old male with multiple myeloma found on recent CT scan to
     have a soft tissue lesion possibly compressing the T11 cord.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal pre- and post-gadolinium T1, T2, STIR; coronal T2; axial
     pre-gadolinium T1- and T2-weighted images from the T8-9 level to the T12 level
     and post-gadolinium T1-weighted images from T7-8 level to the L1-2 levels were
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Correlation is made to a CT of the chest from [**2838-9-24**].  Note is
     also made of the report of the MR of the thoracic spine from [**2836-11-16**].
     
     The visualized cervical and thoracic spinal cord are normal in signal
     intensity with no abnormal enhancement.
     
     There are multiple foci of decreased T1 and increased T2 signal with
     enhancement involving multiple vertebral bodies, which likely represent known
     multiple myeloma.
     
     At T3, there is a small focus of increased T1 and T2 signal with enhancement,
     which likely represents a hemangioma.
     
     At T6, there is a small enhancing increased T2 lesion within the right side of
     the body and a similar appearing lesion within the right posterior elements.
     
     At T7, left posterior rib fracture is noted.
     
     At T8, there is a large expansile mass seen only on the coronal images
     involving the lateral aspect of the left eight rib, consistent with a myeloma.
     
     At T9, there is increased T2 signal enhancing lesion involving the left
     posterior elements.
     
     
     At T11, there is increased T2 signal enhancing lesion involving the posterior
     portion of the vertebral body.  No epidural extension is seen.  A Schmorl's
     node at the superior endplate of this vertebral body is also noted.
     
     At T12, there is increased T2 signal enhancing lesion involving the right
                                                                 (Over)

     L1, there is increased T2 signal enhancing lesion involving the right side of
     the vertebral body.
     
     At L1-2, there is a small disc herniation.
     
     There is deformity and increased T2 signal of the medial left clavicle,
     consistent with the fracture seen on the CT.
     
     No paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Multiple T2 hyperintense enhancing lesions involving multiple
     vertebral bodies of the thoracic and upper lumbar spine consistent with
     multiple myeloma.  Specifically, there is no epidural extension of these
     lesions.  There is no MR evidence of cord compression.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 62 y/o male with MM s/p allo-BMT and DLI [**7-1**] 
with GVHD of skin recently admitted on [**Date range (1) 6688**] for cough and 
shortness of breath concerning for pneumonia or restrictive 
airway disease such as BOOP. He was seen and evaluated by 
pulmonary at that time. PFT's revealed a slightly restrictive 
pattern, but pulmonary felt that the clinical evidence was not 
too suggestive for BOOP. Since discharge, he was on levaquin, 
which was subsequently switched to azithromycin by his 
outpatient oncologist. In addition, his prednisone was increased 
to 60 QD.
.

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple myeloma - s/p MUD nonmyeloablative allogeneic  
transplant [**5-31**] with Campath conditioning. Past treatment 
modalities include: s/p auto PBSCT in [**2833**],DC vaccine, 
Thalidomide, Velcade/Doxil, Cytoxan/Doxil. He has most recently 
been treated with radiation therapy and velcade in preparation 
for this DLI treatment. His 2005 transplant was complicated by 
mucositis with HSV infection, c. diff and enterococcus 
bacteremia. HSV has been resistant to oral valtrex and acyclovir 
but has improved with IV foscarnet, which was most recently 
restarted on [**2837-10-14**]. He has had recurrent diarrhea with 
rectal biopsies showing no evidence of GVHD, and c. diff was 
negative.  
2. Ortho: Pt has extensive skeletal involvement with myeloma. 
Recent hospital amission for prophylactic rod placement in L 
femur with XRT (discharged6/24/06), also with recent radiation 
to  
his right clavicle and right calf as well. Known lesions of Rt 
clavicle, L humerus, recent fracture of L 4th metacarpal. Has 
had pamidronate treatments monthly.

IMAGING: 
[**9-24**] CHEST CT: 
1. Evolving radiation fibrosis right apex, status post radiation 

therapy to a pathological fracture of the medial right clavicle.
2. Bronchial wall thickening, mild bronchial dilation and small 
airways disease within the dependent portions of the lower 
lobes. Infectious small airways disease or chronic aspiration 
should be considered.
3. Diffuse skeletal involvement by multiple myeloma. Destruction 

of posterior aspect of the vertebral body at approximately T11, 
for which it is difficult to evaluate for spinal canal 
involvement on routine CT. Spine MR could be obtained for more 
complete assessment if warranted clinically.
4. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**2838-9-27**] PFT's
Please see OMR records from [**2838-9-27**] for complete values. 
Brielfy, lung volumes appear unchanged, DLCO decreased slightly, 

FEV1/FVC also decreased suggestive of restrictive disease.
.
CT chest [**2838-10-11**]: 
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with 
ground glass ""halos,"" and new ground glass wedge opacities in 
the upper lobe are concerning for a progressive infectious 
process. In an immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus is the 
leading diagnosis. If the patient is immunocompetent, 
mucormycosis is most likely. Atypical pneumonias such as 
mycoplasma or viral infection are less likely. Findings were 
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2. Evolving right apical post-radiation changes.
3. Widespread bone lesions did not change appreciably, the 
evaluation of the D11 vertebral body lesion is difficult on the 
chest CT. If warranted clinically, further evaluation with MRI 
is recommended.
4. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**10-20**] right shoulder xray: IMPRESSION
Displaced fracture of the mid clavicle, more apparent than prior 
study.
.
chest ct [**11-2**]: 
1. New extensive ground-glass opacities and focal areas of 
consolidation, predominantly in the upper and mid lungs. 
Associated extensive traction bronchiectasis. These findings 
raise the possibility of an evolving acute interstitial 
pneumonia with areas of organizing fibrosis. The differential 
also includes a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (or other 
antigen) or possibly eosinophilic pneumonia. Coexisting 
infection is likely, although bronchiolitis seen on the previous 
exam has improved.
2. New, bilateral pleural effusions. Mild smooth septal 
thickening consistent with hydrostatic edema.
3. Lytic lesions within the right side of the T12 vertebral body 
and left eighth rib. Pathologic fracture of the right clavicle.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia.
.
[**11-9**] cxr: IMPRESSION: No improvement in bilateral diffuse 
opacities likely representing bilateral pneumonias
.
[**11-15**] cxr:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-29**] through 18:

Substantial progression of consolidation has continued relative 
to [**11-10**] and 18 with greater involvement of the lower 
lungs. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. 
The heart is normal size. Tip of the left PIC catheter projects 
over the mid SVC. A 3.5 cm wide round opacity projecting over 
the right hilus could be a fissural pleural fluid collection or 
a growing lung abscess.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 62 year-old male with multiple myeloma status 
post allo-BMT and donor lymphocyte infusion [**7-1**] with GVHD of 
skin, who was admitted for dyspnea.
.
1) Hypoxia/Pneumonia:  The patient was admitted on [**10-11**] after 
being evaluated in outpatient clinic. He noted he was feeling 
increasingly SOB with exertion. He had a chest CT that showed 
""worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with 
ground glass ""halos,"" and new ground glass wedge opacities in 
the upper lobe"" which were concerning for a progressive 
infectious process, such as aspergillus. He was initially 
started on vancomycin, levaquin, cefepime and caspofungin. A 
bronch was done and BAL showed growth of aspergillus. Sputum 
culture showed growth of pseudomonas (resistant to cipro and 
intermediate to cefepime). Antibiotics were changed to 
ceftazidime, voriconazole and ambisome. During the patient's 
course he had an episode of desaturation to the low 80s on 2L NC 
O2. His oxygen was increased to 5L NC, but he continued to be 
tachypneic and oxygenation ranged from 88%-98% on 5L. ABG was 
done and was 7.4/36/57/26. CXR appeared consistent with 
worsening opacities/volume overload. He was treated with 40 IV 
lasix and transferred to the FICU for hypoxic respiratory 
distress secondary to aspergillus and pseudomonal pneumonia.  In 
the FICU, the patient's prednisone was decreased from 60 mg to 
15 mg QD. His antibiotics were adjusted ultimately to 
caspofungin and voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenam for 
pseudomonas, and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3362**]. Patient's 
hyypoxia improved daily and by [**2838-10-25**] weaned down to 4-6L NC 
satting between 92-98%.  He was still occasionally using a face 
mask at night, but this was more for humidification. There was 
some suggestion of occasional fluid overload and he noted that 
his SOB felt better after diuresis. He required occasional 
diuresis with lasix.  The patient never required intubation and 
his respiratory status improved with antibiotics and diuresis.  
Once stable, he was transferred out of the FICU, on 3-5 L O2 via 
nasal cannula, meropenem for pseudomonas and voraconazole and 
caspofungin for aspergillus.  On the floor the patient remained 
stable, but still requiring 4-5 L of NC and on one occassion 7L 
face mask.  He remained on nebs and advair for symptom 
improvement.  Was diuresed for a fluid goal of -500 cc/day He 
continued treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole for 
aspergillus, meropenem for coverage of pseudomonas and 
atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3362**].  The infectious disease team 
followed the patient as well, and agreed with his care.  A 
repeat CT scan was more worrisome for BOOP so the patient was 
treated with cellcept and steroids.  He improved slightly, but 
later decompensated and went from 4L NC to face mask and later 
non-rebreather.  The patient's BOOP, GVHD, aspergillus pneumonia 
and later presumed PCP pneumonia were all insults leading to his 
poor pulmonary status.  To maximize his treatement at this point 
he was started on doxycycline for atypicals, given stress dose 
steroids (for BOOP/GVHD), given meropenum (pseudomonas), 
vancomycin (pneumonia coverage), primaquine (PCP) and 
clindamycin (pcp).  Per pulmonary and ID recommendations his 
amiodorone was also stopped as this could contribute to 
pulmonary fibrosis.  Patient remained on NRB, and then continued 
to decline and was only 70-80% saturation on 100% NRB, the 
patient was DNR/DNI and continued to decline at this point with 
antibiotics, lasix, nebs and inhalers.  At this point he was 
started on a morphine drip for  comfort.
.  
2. Aspiration precautions: During his course, the patient had 
one episode of aspiration while lying completely flat to eat. 
Afterwards, he was placed on NPO and then thick liquid diet. He 
was advanced back to regular on [**10-21**]. Speech and swallow passed 
him for regular foods, and he had no further episodes of 
aspiration.
.  
3. Skin GVHD grade 4: The patient has a diffuse rash from skin 
GVHD and receiving prednisone for this. As an outpatient he had 
recently had increased prednisone to 60 QD and this was  
decreased to 40 mg daily on [**10-14**]. Given the increased risk for 
infection, prednisone was again decreased to 15 QD.  Later in 
his course, his prednisone was increased again to 60 mg daily, 
as the patient likely has some pulmonary GVHD that could benefit 
from steroids.  Around that time the patient was also started on 
cellcept to improve his GVHD.  Based on his Chest CT his 
steroids were increased and on [**11-10**] he received 3 days of high 
dose steroids to improve his pulmonary status.  This was 
decreased, and while his pulmonary status worsened, the oral 
steroids and topical steroids helped the patient's skin GVHD. 
.  
4. Oral Ulcers: The patient has a history of chronic resistant 
HSV mucositis. Viral swab from oral ulcers showed HSV-1 at this 
admission. He was started on oral cedofovir and continued pain 
control with magic mouthwash.  His lesions improved and his pain 
remained controlled.  
.  
5. Multiple myeloma: The patient has extensive skeletal 
involvement and is status-post allo transplant in '[**26**] and DLI in 
[**7-1**]. His course has been complicated by skin GVHD and 
mucositis. During his last admission, MRI revealed enhancing 
lesion on thoracic vertebrae. He has had a BM biopsy at this 
admission. BM biopsy revealed no recurrenece of disease.  His 
counts were closely followed and he was given blood for 
hematocrit < 25 and platelets for platelets < 30.  With the 
aspergillus he was at risk for pulmonary bleeding, so his 
platelets were kept > 30. His bony lesions were treated with 
fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  The 
patient's malignancy was stable during the course. 
.  
6. Right shoulder pain/swelling: Patient complained of this 
earlier in admission. Was seen and evaluated by orthopedics with 
no indication for acute surgery. He had a RUE ultrasound that 
was negative for DVT. Pain control with percocet, but on [**10-20**] 
evening complained of worsening pain. Shoulder films revealed 
unchanged non-[**Hospital1 6689**], but did not fully evaluate entire right 
arm. Further imaging subsequently revealed a lytic lesion in his 
right radius. Orthopedic oncology was consulted and recommeneded 
OT consult as well as a splint, which they fitted for him.  His 
pain was controlled with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for 
breakthrough pain.
.  
7. Steroid induced Diabetes:  Initially his sugars remained very 
well controlled most likely because his prednisone dose was low. 
 At this time his insulin was stopped, but as his steroids were 
increased he was restarted on SSI, and his insulin was adjusted 
as needed.
.  
8. Atriatl flutter:  The patient was admittien on amiodarone, 
given his history of atrial fibrillatin. During his course he 
had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, but would 
spontaneously convert back to sinus rhythm.  He never required 
intervention and as his was post-ablation, given his poor 
pulmonary status and risk for increased pulmonary fibrosis his 
amiodorone was stopped per infectious disease and pulmonary 
recommendations.  The patient was followed closely and had no 
further issues.
.  
9. Hypertension: The patient was continued on his metoprolol. 
His bumax was stopped in the ICU for borderline low blood 
pressure.  As he remained normotensive on th metoprolol his 
bumex was not restarted.   
.
10. Hematuria: The patient had intermittent hematuria during his 
course that was attributed to his low platelets and trauma from 
the follow.  He had urine cultures followed, and as he was not 
infected was given platelets as needed and medications to 
control bladder spasms.
.
11. Dispo: The patient expired on [**2838-11-17**] on morphine drip.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Productive cough, worsening of shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from [**2838-9-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Unenhanced MDCT of the chest including expiration and inspiration
     as well as coronal and sagittal recons were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There is no mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymphadenopathy.  The aorta and
     pulmonary arteries are unremarkable with the limitation of an unenhanced
     study.  The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The
     cardiac cavities have less density comparing to the cardiac wall suggesting
     anemia.  Coronary calcifications involve all native coronary arteries,
     predominantly the LAD.  The aortic valve leaflets are calcified as well.
     
     Multiple bone lesions of known myeloma disease includes the posterior portion
     of the body of D11 (a lytic lesion), the right clavicle pathologic fracture,
     soft tissue expansile lytic lesions of the eighth left rib, and the sclerotic
     lesion in the first right rib. The vertebral lesion enters the spinal canal
     but evaluation of the  spinal cord compression is difficult.
     
     The assessment of lung parenchyma demonstrates worsening of right apical
     geographically marginated ground glass and reticular opacities progressing up
     to consolidations, possibly due to evolving post-radiation changes.  The
     bronchial wall thickening, mild bronchial dilatation predominantly in the
     lower lobes, middle lobe and lingula are again noted being more pronounced
     predominantly in the lower lobe, lingula and right middle lobe. The
     centrilobular branching opacities have been increased in number.
     
     In addition, there are new solid nodules surrounded by ground glass opacity,
     halo sign in right upper lobe, series 3, image 43, and several areas of wedge-
     shaped ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe.
     
     The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusions.  Several
     subsegmental airways are impacted by bronchial secretions.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     The images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening diffuse bronchial wall thickening, new nodules with ground glass
     ""halos,"" and new ground glass wedge opacities in the upper lobe are concerning
     for a progressive infectious process.  In an immunocompromised patient,
     Aspergillus is the leading diagnosis.  If the patient is immunocompetent,
     mucormycosis is most likely.  Atypical pneumonias such as mycoplasma or viral
     infection are less likely.  Findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3415**].
     2.  Evolving right apical post-radiation changes.
     3.  Widespread bone lesions did not change appreciably, the evaluation of the
     D11 vertebral body lesion is difficult on the chest CT.  If warranted
     clinically, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.

     INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, now with worsening cough and shortness of
     breath.  Query sinusitis.
     
     CT SINUSES:  Frontal sinuses are clear.
     
     There is scattered opacification of ethmoid air cells.
     
     Mild mucosal thickening of both maxillary sinuses is noted, with aerosolized
     secretions; some high density material is seen within the mucosal thickening
     likely representing inspissated secretions vs fungal colonization.
     
     Sphenoid sinuses are clear.
     
     Mastoid air cells are clear.
     
     Small amount of debris in both external auditory canals is noted, likely
     cerumen.
     
     Cavernous carotids are calcified.
     
     Superior portion of nasal cavity is patent.  Sphenoethmoid recesses are
     patent.
     
     There is a destructive expansile lesion of the right mandibular coronoid
     process, not completely imaged, but without discernable soft tissue lesion.
     Periosteal new bone formation is also seen. Left mandibular ramus and
     remainder of mandible are normal.  
     
     8 mm soft tissue nodule seen along the lateral aspect of the left masseter.
     This may represent a lymph node or a salivary gland tumor.
     
     Left temporomandibular joint is within normal limits.  Right shows
     degenerative change.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.	Destructive lesion of right mandibular ramus, likely metastasis.
     
     2.	Mild sinusitis as described above; high density material may represent
     inspissated secretions vs fungal colonization.

     of the left lung in a perihilar distribution, which are relatively new.  Lung
     volumes are diminished with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  Mild central
     peribronchial coughing is identified.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  PICC line tip not definitively identified.  The apical pneumonia
     again seen.  There has been interval development of subtle nodular opacities
     in the lateral left perihilar region, which may represent separate foci of
     infection.

     AP CHEST 2:41 a.m. [**10-20**]
     
     HISTORY:  PICC line placement.  Aspergillus and pseudomonas infection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-20**] through [**10-18**]:
     
     Ground glass opacification in the left perihilar and mid lung has worsened
     since [**10-18**] and a region of consolidation at the right apex is also more
     pronounced.  This probably represents deposition of edema and areas of active
     infection.  Heart size normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Some of
     the mediastinal fullness is probably due to lymph node enlargement.

     INDICATION FOR EXAM:  62-year-old man with multiple myeloma that needs IV
     access.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 126**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the
     attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout the
     procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Since no suitable veins were visible, ultrasound was
     used was identify the left basilic vein, which was patent and compressible.
     The left arm of the patient was then prepped and draped in standard sterile
     fashion.  After injection of 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge needle was then
     advanced under ultrasonographic guidance into the left basilic vein.  Hard
     copies of the ultrasound images were obtained before and after the
     venipuncture.  A 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the
     distal part of the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then
     exchanged for a 5 French micropuncture sheath.  Based on the markers in the
     guidewire it was determined that a length of 45 cm would be suitable.  The
     line was then trimmed to this length and advanced over the wire into the
     distal part of the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire and the peel-
     away sheath were then removed.  The line was flushed, heplocked and
     statlocked.  Final fluoroscopic image of the chest demonstrates the tip of the
     catheter to be located in the distal part of the SVC.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45-cm long double-lumen line placed via
     the left basilic vein with the tip in the distal part of the SVC.  The line is
     ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Increased shortness of breath in a patient with known
     aspergillosis and pseudomonas infection.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**10-22**], [**10-20**], and [**10-16**], 2006.
     
     Gradual worsening of bilateral upper lobe consolidation is demonstrated since
     [**10-20**] with additional increasing consolidations between [**10-22**] and
     the current exam.  The lower lungs have been unchanged.  There is no sizable
     pleural effusion.  Multiple lytic and expansile lesions in the rib are noted
     in a patient with known myeloma.
     
     The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  The
     left PICC line tip is in the inferior portion of SVC.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Gradual worsening of bilateral upper lobe consolidations.

     HISTORY:  Aspergillus and pseudomonas infection with continuing hypoxia.  
     
     A left PICC line is in proximal SVC.  There are low lung volumes.  Allowing
     for this, heart size is normal.  There are persistent bilateral predominantly
     upper lobe and right lower zone opacities, essentially unchanged since the
     prior study of [**2838-10-31**], consistent with bilateral pneumonia.  The
     right clavicular fracture and left rib lesion related to the myelomatosis is
     again demonstrated.  No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma, status post transplant.  Productive cough which
     is worsening.  Shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISONS:  CT chest, [**2838-10-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast MDCT images were obtained through the lungs in
     a supine position.  Expiratory images were also obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Significant worsening of ground-glass
     opacities with focal areas of airspace consolidation is seen.  These findings
     are most severe within the upper and mid lung zones.  There is also interval
     development of marked traction bronchiectasis within the upper lobes
     bilaterally and right middle lobe.  Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1680**] opacities within the right
     lower lobe and nodular opacities within the left upper lobe have slightly
     improved in the interval, likely indicating an improved component of
     infection. There has been interval development of small pleural effusions
     bilaterally. There are increased smooth septal thickening consistent with a
     component of hydrostatic edema.
     
     Coronary artery and aortic valve calcifications are again identified.  A left
     subclavian central venous line terminates within the SVC.  No pathologic
     lymphadenopathy is identified.  There is mild soft tissue stranding throughout
     the soft tissues consistent with anasarca.  There is no pericardial effusion.
     
     Bone windows again show multiple lytic lesions consistent with multiple
     myeloma.  There is a pathologic fracture with callus formation within the
     right clavicle.  Lytic lesions are also identified within the left eighth rib,
     slightly worse and the right-side of the T12 vertebral body.
     
     Expiration views show excessive collapse of the trachea and bronchi consistent
     with tracheobronchomalacia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  New extensive ground-glass opacities and focal areas of consolidation,
     predominantly in the upper and mid lungs.  Associated extensive traction
     bronchiectasis. These findings raise the possibility of an evolving acute
     interstitial pneumonia with areas of organizing fibrosis.  The differential
     also includes a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (or other antigen) or
                                                                 (Over)

     possibly eosinophilic pneumonia.  Coexisting infection is likely, although
     bronchiolitis seen on the previous exam has improved.
     
     2.  New, bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild smooth septal thickening
     consistent with hydrostatic edema.
     
     3.  Lytic lesions within the right side of the T12 vertebral body and left
     eighth rib.  Pathologic fracture of the right clavicle.

     Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of November the 6th.  Today's
     film shows considerable movement artifact and therefore is not easily
     comparable with the prior chest x-ray.  The multiple areas of opacity are
     again noted and do not appear significantly changed.  However, an area of
     infiltrate in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe is present
     obscuring the left hemidiaphragm in this region is seen.  This was not present
     on prior chest x-ray.
     
     IMPRESSION:  New focus of infiltrate in left lower lobe.  Otherwise, no
     change.

     COMPARISON:  CXR [**2838-11-8**] and multiple priors.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  Upright plain radiograph of the chest.  Left-sided
     PICC line is identified with its tip overlying the proximal portion of the
     superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Persistent
     bilateral upper lobe greater than lower lobe opacities are again identified
     and essentially unchanged compared to [**2838-11-1**].  This is again
     consistent with bilateral pneumonias and no improvement is identified.  Small
     bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  Previously identified right
     clavicular fracture is evident.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No improvement in bilateral diffuse opacities likely representing
     bilateral pneumonias.

     Worsening hypoxia.
     
     COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2838-11-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Left upper extremity PICC line is stable in course and position. 
     Again noted are extensive bilateral patchy peripheral opacities in both lungs
     favoring the upper lobes.  There has been a relative clearing in the lower
     lobe disease burden.  No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  Again noted is
     a proximal diaphyseal right clavicle fracture, likely pathologic.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Subtle improved aeration and clearing in the lower lobes with
     extensive upper lobe peripheral opacities persisting.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     AP CHEST 7:25 A.M., [**11-15**].
     
     HISTORY:  Stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.  Aspergillus and
     Pseudomonas infection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-29**] through 18:
     
     Substantial progression of consolidation has continued relative to [**11-10**]
     and 18 with greater involvement of the lower lungs.  There is no pneumothorax
     or appreciable pleural effusion.  The heart is normal size.  Tip of the left
     PIC catheter projects over the mid SVC.  A 3.5 cm wide round opacity
     projecting over the right hilus could be a fissural pleural fluid collection
     or a growing lung abscess.
