Admission Date:  [**2674-11-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2674-12-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2582-3-12**]     Sex:  M

Service:  .

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the Discharge Summary.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] continued to do well from a cardiovascular point of
view while in the hospital; however, his mental status was
noted to deteriorate and he became delirious while on the
floor.

He was noted to have difficulty swallowing.  The patient
underwent a video swallow study which showed aspiration.  The
Speech and Language pathologist felt that this was secondary
to his lack of attention and not a mechanical problem with
his swallow.

A discussion was had with the patient's wife who reiterated
that the patient would not want an NG tube or a PEG tube.
The family elected to carefully feed the patient and accept
the risk of aspiration.  Currently, the patient is tolerating
a thickened liquid diet.  He should sit bolt upright for
meals and should have 1:1 observation.

On the date of discharge, the patient's mental status was
noted to improve slightly.  He is currently alert and
oriented to person as well as to hospital.  The patient
continued to receive Risperidone as needed for agitation
while in-house.

     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, reported pneumonia at outside hospital.
     Tachypnea with rales.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2674-12-1**].
     
     PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an improved congestive
     heart failure pattern with less prominence of the pulmonary vascularity. There
     are continued patchy opacities within both lungs, probably representing
     atelectasis.  There is slightly increased opacity within the left lower lobe.
     The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  A
     transfemoral SG catheter remains in position with its tip in the right main
     pulmonary artery.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Slightly increased opacity at the left lung base probably represents
     atelectasis but pneumonia is not excluded.
     2. Slightly improved CHF pattern.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Altered mental status, evaluate for swallowing function.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Video oropharyngeal swallow was performed in conjunction with
     speech therapy.  Barium of nectar, pudding and thin consistencies was
     administered.
     
     FINDINGS:  The exam was extremely limited due to patient's inability to follow
     instructions and altered mental status.  The oral phase was severely impaired
     with poor bolus control, pumping and weakness in tongue movements and
     decreased oral transit time.  There was premature spillover into the vallecula
     and piriform sinuses with aspiration into the trachea; minimal cough was
     elicited and it was not effective.  When the swallow was normally initiated,
     there was normal laryngeal elevation and epiglottic deflection and at that
     time, aspiration was not seen.  For further details, refer to report by the
     speech therapist.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Aspiration during and after swallow with ineffective cough.  Exam
     limited by patient's altered mental status.
