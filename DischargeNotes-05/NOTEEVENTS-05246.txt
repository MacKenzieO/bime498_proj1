History of Present Illness:
Pt is 74 yo m w/ COPD, DM, h/o prostate CA, who presented to the 
ED after having decreased responsiveness at his nursing homee.  
Pt had FS to 300's, received insulin, and FS decreased to 180's 
after EMS arrived.  Pt reportedly admitted to SOB x several 
weeks, but denies CP.  No N/V/F/C.  Denies hematemesis or bloody 
stools.  Pt had increasing edema over past several weeks, and 
Lasix was recently increased from 40mg qd to 40mg bid.
.
In the ED, pt was found to have hct of 14.8 and melena on rectal 
exam.  NGL was negative. He had a troponin of 0.12 and EKG 
changes.  He reportedly was alert in the ED, but then on arrival 
to the FICU became less responsive and had periods of apnea. He 
was placed on PSV 6/6 and his respiratory status stabiliezed.  
He became slightly more responsive and did not tolerate BiPAP 
mask.

TTE: Conclusions:  
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular  
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal  
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded.  
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). 
There is no  
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion  
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of 
aortic valve  
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately  
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8 
cm2) The mitral  
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild  
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly  
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is  
no pericardial effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1866**] is a 74 year old man with COPD, DM 2, HTN, admitted 
for unresponsivenes, found to have profound anemia of 14.8, with 
report of dark tarry stool in ED. He was initially intubated for 
colonoscopy/EGD, and could not be extubated afterward. His brief 
ICU course, by problem:
.
#) Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on admission. 
EGD/colonoscopy unrevealing.  Per GI, capsule likely not 
indicated, patient's behavioral issues may prevent him from 
cooperating with capsule study requirements. No evidence of 
active GI bleed or ischemia, thus lower threshold for 
transfusion.
.
#) Respiratory failure: Initially failed extubation secondary to 
presumed VAP. On [**12-28**], he began to have thick green secretions 
and RR > 30 with fever to 101.8; concern for VAP, placed on 
vancomycin and cefepime.  Chest xray showed evidence of 
CHF/volume overload.  ECHO showed MR, AS, diastolic 
failure--likely all contributing as well. Currently growing GNR 
in sputum for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
.
#) Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on 
admission. Per GI, capsule likely not indicated, patient's 
behavioral issues may prevent him from cooperating with capsule 
study requirements. No evidence of active GI bleed or ischemia, 
thus lower threshold for transfusion. 
.  
#) Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies 
considered, including HIT (HIT antibodies negative), drug 
effect. Platelets 179 on [**1-1**]. 
.
#) NSTEMI: most likely due to demand ischemia in setting of 
profound anemia. Pt has HTN, and now evidence of moderate AS on 
TTE.  Cardiology aware and recommended transfusing to Hct > 30; 
will consider BB once hemodynamically stable.
- Restart ASA and heparin in setting of GIB
- Attempt re-start low-dose beta-blocker today
- continue statin
.  
#) Mental status change:  Pt currently intubated and sedated.  
Mental status changes likely multifactorial in setting of 
anemia, NSTEMI, OSA, hyperglycemia, and hypercarbia in patient 
with underlying dementia and schizoaffective d/o.  Per 
healthcare proxy, at baseline patient usually more quiet and 
less agitated/ aggressive, but has periods of 
agitation/aggression. Resolved over several days post discharge 
from the ICU.
.   
#) DM 2: pt on insulin 70/30 bid at rehab, here was on 1/2 dose 
until [**12-31**] when 2 more units AM and PM were added. Glucose not 
tightly managed, but given possibility of extubation (and 
holding tube feeds), will not start long-acting insulin until 
after extubation
- Continue to titrate up by 2 units (18units qAM, 17units qPM)
- HISS

     TWO VIEW CHEST [**3432-12-24**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
     
     Examination is technically limited due to low lung volume and use of AP rather
     than PA technique.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, and
     pulmonary vascularity is considered within normal limits allowing for low lung
     volumes.  Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are present, more confluent on the
     right than the left.  There is also a subtle area of increased opacity in the
     right middle lobe, best visualized on the lateral view.  No pleural effusions
     are identified.  Bones are diffusely demineralized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Low lung volumes.  Multifocal opacities in right middle and both lower lobes.
     Although possibly due to atelectasis, the right middle/lower lobe opacities
     are suspicious for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.

NPN

This is a 74 yo male with schizoaffective d/o, hypothyroidism, HTN, DM, COPD, [**Doctor Last Name 65**] apnea, dementia who was found unresponsive at the nursing home, EMS was able to wake him up.  In the EW he was still somulent and becoming more so while he was there.  His HCT was 14, he was neg from above and OB pos below.  He was given a unit of blood and sent here.  In the MICU he was placed on BIPAP, his ABG was 7.37/55/70 on [**7-10**] without 02 bled in. 

Neuro: He was initially very somulent, having [**Doctor Last Name 65**] apnea and desated down to 30 but then went up to the upper 90s when he started to breath again.  He would follow simple commands.  He has had periods of aggitation, getting out of bed, trying to urinate, explained that he had a groin line in that could easily bleed and also he has a foley in, he said that he didn't care.  He was given 5 mg of IV haldol with good effect but it didn't last.  Again he was getting out of bed, bed alarm had been on since admit, pulled out his groin line, given 5 mg IV of haldol and 1 mg IV ativan.  He slept for 2 hours, 02 SAT has been maintained on 2 L NC.  He is now on sitters and his hands are restrained.

CV:  His vitals have been stable, he is ruling in for an MI and will need additional enzymes at midnight.

Resp:  Lung sounds are difficult to assess, his 02 SAT on 2 liters have been in the upper 90s.  As above, he does have [**Doctor Last Name 65**] apnea, and will drop his SATs to 30.

GI:  It is felt that he has had a slow GIB, he has been c/o feeling SOB x2 weeks, his BUN is in the 20s, he has not had any stool here. His HCT was 17 after 1 unit of blood, we would like his HCT to be ~ 30.  He will need 3 additional units after the present on finishes and he will also need a dose of lasix in the middle of the next unit.

GU:  We took his foley out in hope of decreasing his aggitation, he had put out ~ 300cc prior to this of light colored urine.  He has not voided since it was removed.

Access:  He has 2 periferal IVs, we were trying to have IV place PIC in his because it was apparent that a central line would not be optimal for him.

Soc:  We talked with his sister, she thinks that he should be seen by GI and get scoped.  He is a DNR/DNI.

Neuro:  Pt has been lethagic for most of the day, occationally following commands, he has not said a lot today, some of it I have not understood due to mummbling other times he has sworn and told me to shut up.  He conts to have sitters, and wrist restraints.  He was pulling at what ever he could get his hands on so they were put in mits as well the wrist restraints, I took the mits off soon because it made him more aggitated.  He was given 5 mg of IV haldol for aggitation and he eventially settled down.

CV:  SBP 130s-170s/50s-60s, when aggitated he was in the low 100s, when sleeping he has been 80s-90s.  His QTCs are being followed due to the haldol.  His CPKs have remained ~ 300 and his MBs are slowly trending down from the 4s to the 3s.

Resp:  He conts to have [**Doctor Last Name 65**] apnea and will drop to the 70s for an 02 SAT despite oxygen.  His lung sounds are difficult to assess because of his poor effort.

GI:  He has not had any stool, his HCT is 29.5 this morning, to be rechecked this afternoon.  He was seen by GI, he will be scoped from above and below tomorrow, to be intubated this afternoon and golytle to be started.

     STUDY:  Portable chest radiograph.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with GI bleed and intubated with NG tube placed. Evaluate
     position and the need for change.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal chest radiograph was obtained.  Timed 5:55 a.m.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3432-12-26**].
     
     REPORT.
     
     The examination is suboptimal quality.  The patient is intubated.  The tip of
     the ET tube is seen, but its relationship to the carina is difficult to
     evaluate.  It is probably in unchanged position from before at which point, it
     was 3.5 cm from the tip of the carina.  A right-sided NG tube is identified.
     The tip of this courses through the mediastinum but its terminus is not seen.
     There is a large left-sided pleural effusion identified.  There is ill-defined
     bilateral opacity, slightly worse on the right, but the more focal area of
     consolidation identified on the right side that was previously appreciated in
     [**12-25**] is less well appreciated.  Overall, the appearances are probably
     stable, but again a repeat radiograph would be of value.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Probable little interval change, but suboptimal radiograph.  Large left-sided
     effusion with consolidation of both lobes, probably more so on the right than
     the left.  The appearances likely reflect pulmonary edema and are overall
     unchanged little from prior radiographs.
     
     Probable stable failure with left-sided effusion.  Suboptimal radiograph.

     Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**3432-12-27**].
     
     The chest radiograph is suboptimal due to motion and respiratory artifacts. 
     The ET tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is visualized
     till the mid portion of the esophagus and cannot be followed below this level
     due to underpenetration of this film.  The patient still has pulmonary edema,
     bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis.  The underlying

     FINDINGS:  Support tubes and lines remain stable.  Lung volumes remain
     markedly low.  Linear opacity in the lateral left lung is likely atelectasis. 
     Less discrete opacity is noted in the right perihilar and right basilar
     region.  There is superimposed hydrostatic edema.  There is left lower lobe
     volume loss.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Hydrostatic edema likely from a cardiogenic etiology.  The focal
     opacities in the right mid lung and right base may be confluent edema,
     although developing pneumonias cannot be excluded.  Bilateral pleural
     effusions, left greater than right.

     AP CHEST, [**1-4**], 8:57 A.M.
     
     HISTORY:  Hypoxia and CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-28**] through 26:
     
     Lung volumes are lower, following extubation.  The left upper lobe is clear
     but did the regions of opacity in both lower lungs zones and in the midlung on
     the right any of which could be pneumonia, is largely due to dependent pleural
     effusion.  Large cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Tip of the left
     subclavian line projects over the left brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax.

     CHEST SUPINE, PORTABLE CHEST
     
     HISTORY:  Rule out pneumonia, hypoxia.
     
     Two supine views.  Comparison with [**3433-1-4**].  There is increased streaky
     density at the right base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.  There is
     no definite focal consolidation.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent as
     before, but the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette may be exaggerated by
     technique.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A left subclavian catheter
     remains in place.  Compared with the previous study, increased density in the
     right mid lung appears improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Very limited study demonstrating subsegmental atelectasis at the
     right base.  There is no definite focal consolidation but a small area of
     pneumonia cannot be excluded.

     Portable AP chest dated [**3433-1-11**] is compared to the prior from [**3433-1-5**] and

     definite pulmonary vascular congestion, however, there are bilateral lower
     lobe and right middle lobe patchy perihilar opacities consistent with
     pulmonary edema although superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.  There
     are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with patchy bilateral perihilar opacities likely
     representing pulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

     INDICATION:  Hypoxia and tachycardia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images were obtained through the chest, first
     without contrast with a low-dose technique, followed by contrast-enhanced CT
     angiogram of the chest.  Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal reformatted
     images were obtained.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Examination
     is limited by patient motion.  There is no central or segmental pulmonary
     embolus.  The aorta is normal in caliber.  There is no evidence of dissection.
     Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic root and arch.  The
     heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The airways are
     patent to the segmental level bilaterally.  There is minimal airspace opacity
     in the lung bases bilaterally, which most likely represent combination of
     pulmonary hydrostatic edema and dependent changes.  There are few focal patchy
     opacities in the right middle and lower lobes. There are no pleural effusions.
     There is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph
     nodes; however, multiple prominent less than 10 mm lymph nodes are seen in the
     prevascular region of the mediastinum. Limited images through the upper
     abdomen show unremarkable portions of the liver and spleen. There appears to
     be air within the gallbladder, which may be within stones.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
     
     CT REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Examination limited by patient motion, however, no central or segmental
     pulmonary embolus is identified.  No aortic dissection.

Events:  Pt became more restless, requiring 4pt restraints.  Foley clotted due to his pulling on catheter.  BiPap left on all night but pt very agitated most of the night.

Neuro:  Pt oriented to person only. He started out being mostly cooperative, eating dinner with minimal assistance, and watching TV.  However he became increasingly restless trying to get OOB ""to go to the bathroom"".  He kept pulling on the foley.  He was put in wrist restraints at 11pt, given haldol 4mg IVP which did not change his behavior at all.  He had to be placed in 4pt restrains after he persisted in throwing his legs over the rails and attempting to sit up between the rails.  He was uncooperative with care and was becoming a danger to hurting hiself.  He remains with security sitters for his safety.  

Cardiac:  B/P 150-180/60's, HR 80-90's.  K+ at 0400 was 3.4.

GU:  He was a total of ~2l negative fluid balaance for [**1-12**].  His U/O was ""0"" at 12mn.  The urine at 2200 was pink due to his pulling on the foley.  At 0200 when his urine output was again ""0"", they foley was irrigated but no return was obtained.  The foley was changed to 20F and a large blood clot came out and he drained 100cc brown urine with clots.  He has continued to drain brown urine in small amounts.

GI:  He ate a very good supper.  He is able to swallow his pills without argument.  He has (+) bowel sounds, no stool

Social:  His sister called last night to ask why he was not moved.   When this condition was explained to her she said that she would me in late this am to discuss the plans about [**Doctor First Name 250**].

     INDICATION:  74-year-old man with COPD, CHF here with questionable pneumonia.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**1-21**], 2006.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest in upright position.  Lung volumes are low
     which limits the study.  Since prior exam, there has been interval withdrawal
     of the right PICC.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is blunting of
     the left costophrenic angle which could represent small pleural effusion or
     atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or consolidation.  The pulmonary
     vasculature is normal. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No CHF or pneumonia.
