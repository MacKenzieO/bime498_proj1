     HISTORY:  Tube check.
     
     Portable AP chest radiograph was performed.  No prior studies.
     
     The ETT and OGT are appropriately positioned.  There is tortuosity and
     calcification of the aorta.  The heart is difficult to assess but appears
     slightly enlarged.  There is vascular redistribution suggesting mild
     congestive failure.  There is a hazy opacity involving the entire right lung,
     which may represent layering pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
     osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned ET and OG tube.  Mild congestive failure
     and probably a right-sided effusion.

     INDICATION:  Intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage
     centered in the left basal ganglia extending superiorly to the left corona
     radiata and centrum semiovale and inferiorly to the posterior limb of the
     internal capsule and thalamus.  There is significant amount of
     intraventricular blood, predominantly involving the left lateral ventricle.
     There is a tiny amount of hemorrhage seen within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 116**] of the
     right lateral ventricle as well as in the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 116**] and third
     ventricle.  There is some shift of normally midline structures to the right
     with some subfalcine herniation.  There is no evidence of uncal displacement.
     
     There is an area of hypodensity within the right temporal lobe with loss of
     [**Doctor Last Name 20**]-white differentiation consistent with an old infarct.  There is a large
     calcified right frontal convexity meningioma measuring 2.8 cm.
     
     Mild mucosal thickening is noted within the ethmoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left basal
     ganglia, slight subfalcine herniation and intraventricular hemorrhage.

     INDICATION:  Follow up intracranial hemorrhage, assess for shift and
     hydrocephalus.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Comparison is made to the previous study of [**3500-12-25**].
     
     There has been no extension of the large left basal ganglionic hemorrhage.
     there is an intraventricular component of the hemorrhage, which is also
     stable. The lateral ventricles are mildly dilated, but not significantly
     changed in size, compared to the previous study.  There is mild midline shift
     to the right. This is not changed.  The basal cisterns remain well visualized.
     
     There are no other changes in the appearance of the brain.  Again noted is an
     old right temporal lobe infarction and a high right frontal region calcified
     mass, presumably a meningioma.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable left basal ganglionic and intraventricular hemorrhage.

     CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
     
     Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, no
     definite infiltrate.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, presumably related to
     low lung volumes.  An ET tube is present, tip approximately 1.3 cm above the
     carina, relatively low.  An NG tube is present, tip obscured due to
     underpenetration.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, no definite infiltrate.
     Attention to ET tube is recommended, as the positioning on today's exam seems
     relatively low compared with 11/29.

     within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 116**] of the right lateral ventricle.  There is a stable
     old right temporal lobe infarct. The calcified presumed meningioma in the
     right frontal region is unchanged.  Compared with the prior study there does
     not appear to be a significant interval change in the ventricular size. The
     hemorrhage within the third ventricle is less apparent on the present study.
     There continues to be a small amount of shift of normal midline structures

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

      venous catheter

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION: Central line catheter placement.
     
     Comparison is made to previous radiograph of earlier the same day.
     
     A right subclavian central venous catheter has been placed and terminates in
     the distal superior vena cava.  No pneumothorax is identified.  However,
     exclusion of the right costophrenic angle area from the radiograph limits
     assessment for basilar pneumothorax.
     
     An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, allowing for flexed position
     of the patient's neck.  The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A patchy left lower lobe opacity
     shows some interval improvement.  The right lung is grossly clear, allowing
     for low lung volumes.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Satisfactory placement of central venous catheter.  No pneumothorax is
     detected, but additional view to include entire right lung base would be
     helpful to exclude basilar pneumothorax.
     
     2. Improving left lower lobe opacity, likely due to atelectasis.

     endotracheal tube is in proper position. There is increased interstitial

     IMPRESSION:  Though it is difficult to assess the pulmonary vasculature in
     this supine radiograph, the increased interstitial pattern of pulmonary
     opacity is suggestive of evolving pulmonary edema.

Respiratory Care:
Pt. remains on IPS=14, peep=5, and FIO2 of 50%.  At times, Pt. becomes very tachypneac and agitated, and appears to become very bronchospastic.  He responds well to manual ventilation and/or brief periods on A/C until FRC is restored.  Pt. also has periods of bradypnea, with increased VT's ~1L and RR in single digits.  This would lead me to want ot wean IPS, but when this is attempted (with targetted VT's ~ 600cc), Pt. soon reverts to tachypnea and agitation.  B/S course and at times very wheezy.  ETS for small to moderate, thick, yellow.  Alb./Atr MDI's given with good effect.  Will continue on present settings, and perform as outlined above when needed.  Pt. may also benefit from the addition of inhaled steroids.  Will follow.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, assess change.  There has been interval
     change in neurological status.
     
     There is a prior study dated [**3500-12-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from skull base to higher
     convexities.  No intravenous contrast was administered.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is evolution of the left basal ganglia hemorrhage and
     currently measures 3.1 x 1.7 cm with surrounding hypodensity consistent with
     vasogenic edema.  There was mild left-to-right midline shift of the normally
     midline structures.  This is decreased in comparison to the prior examination.
     There is mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle.  There is a small amount
     of hemorrhage within the occipital horns bilaterally. There are no other areas
     of hemorrhage.  There is a stable old right temporal lobe infarct.  There is a
     calcified extra-axial mass off the higher convexities on the right which is
     unchanged and probably represents a calcified meningioma.  The bony calvarium
     and paranasal sinuses are clear.  The bony calvarium is intact.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evolution of the left basal ganglia hemorrhage.  There is no
     evidence of new hemorrhage.
     
     There is a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, as well.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TWO VIEW CHEST:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pre-operative assessment in patient with gangrene.
     
     Comparison is made to previous radiograph of [**3501-1-17**].
     
     Allowing for lung volumes, the heart size is within normal limits and stable
     compared to the previous study.  The aorta is tortuous and the pulmonary
     vascularity is normal.  There is a focal linear opacity present in the right
     perihilar region attributed to focal discoid atelectasis.  Please note that
     the lateral radiograph is technically suboptimal due to suboptimal
     positioning, patient motion and low lung volumes.  Moreover the right
     costophrenic angle is excluded from the study and cannot be assessed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Technically suboptimal pre-operative chest radiograph
     demonstrating focal discoid atelectasis in right perihilar region with
     otherwise clear lungs.  Due to technically unsatisfactory exam, the patient
     will be asked to return for repeat radiograph at no additional charge.

     premature spilling.  There is normal epiglottic deflection and laryngeal
     elevation. No evidence of penetration.  Aspiration is noted with nectar and
     thin liquid.  There is significant oral residua.  Cough is noted after
     aspiration.
