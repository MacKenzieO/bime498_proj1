Admission Date:  [**3266-6-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**3266-6-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**3180-11-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery, Purple Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6586**] is an
86-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency
Department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and right
upper quadrant pain for two days.

This history was obtained per his granddaughter and wife due
to the patient's dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  He
apparently had been complaining of constant pain and denied
having any previous episodes.  There was no postprandial
pain.  No fevers.  No chills.  No changes in bowel habits.
He had been slightly constipated recently but denied any
diarrhea.  He denied any history of ulcerative disease.  He
was noted at this time to be slightly jaundiced.  There had
been on recent weight loss.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alzheimer's disease.
2.  Question or a prior arrhythmia.
3.  Previous eye surgery.
4.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Verapamil, Aricept, digoxin,
nitroglycerin patch, Prozac, and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate was 74,
blood pressure was 168/58, and oxygen saturation was 98% on
room air.  In general, he was nonverbal but was alert and in
no apparent distress.  He was noted to be jaundiced with
scleral icterus.  His neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy, and no jugular venous distention.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart
examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with
normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  The
abdomen was soft with right upper quadrant tenderness to both
palpation and percussion.  There were no masses palpated.
His extremities were warm and well perfused with no
peripheral edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratory studies on admission revealed his white blood cell
count was found to 11.6 and hematocrit was 42.3.  His
electrolytes revealed sodium was 142, potassium was 3.9,
chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was
26, and his creatinine was 1.  His liver function tests
revealed abnormalities with his ALT being elevated at 417,
and his AST being evaluated at 284.  His alkaline phosphatase
was 326 with a total bilirubin of 6.3.  Amylase and lipase
were within normal limits.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A right upper quadrant
ultrasound was performed which showed a distended gallbladder
containing small stones and sludge.  There was no evidence of
common bile ductal dilatation, or gallbladder wall edema, or
pericholecystic fluid.  The patient did not have a
sonographic [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6586**] was started
on antibiotics (cefoxitin and Flagyl) in the Emergency
Department, and an ERCP consultation was obtained.

He was taken to the endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography suite on the following morning and
found to have an impacted stone seen at the major ampulla as
well as a large periampullary diverticulum.   A large filling
defect in the distal common bile duct was also noted as well
as evidence of acute cholangitis.  A distal common bile duct
stone extraction as well as biliary sphincterotomy were
performed.  Please refer to the dictated Gastroenterology
note for further details of the procedure.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was admitted to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit following his procedure.  At
this time, he was stated on ampicillin, gentamicin, and
Flagyl and immediately began to improve his clinical picture.
His abdominal pain began to resolve, and he became afebrile
and more alert.

His liver function tests began to normalize with a drop in
his total bilirubin to 3.2 by post procedure day two as well
as drops in his transaminases and alkaline phosphatase.

The patient was kept on his intravenous antibiotics with a
change to Unasyn, and his home medications were slowly added
back to his regimen.  On post procedure day three, he was
stable and ready for discharge to the regular floor.

He continued to improve and was transferred to the regular
patient floor as soon as a bed became available.  On post
procedure day four, his total bilirubin had further decreased
to 1.5, and his transaminases were 107 and 43 (respectively),
with an alkaline phosphatase of 147.  He continued to remain
afebrile with no further abdominal tenderness.  At this time,
he was restarted on a diet and his medications.  He continued
to improve.

On hospital day six, post procedure day five, it was felt
that the patient was stable and ready for discharge.  Due to
his advanced age, the severity of his infection at the time
of admission, and his Alzheimer's disease it was felt that he
would benefit for a short stay in a rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to a [**Hospital 1058**]
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ascending cholangitis.
2.  Cholelithiasis.
3.  Status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography with extraction of common bile duct
stone and biliary sphincterotomy.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Alzheimer's disease.
6.  Inguinal hernia.
7.  Status post eye surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aricept 10 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Verapamil 40 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Nystatin swish-and-swallow.
