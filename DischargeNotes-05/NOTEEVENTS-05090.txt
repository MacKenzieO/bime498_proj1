Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old man, who
presents with chest pain down his left arm that began
suddenly today at 1:30 p.m. while at a barbecue with his wife
(he was at rest).  He complained of tooth pain that quickly
became substernal chest pain.  He is status post MI with LAD
stent at the [**Hospital1 5808**] Hospital 3 years ago.  He also
has a long smoking history and questionable hypertension.  He
reports that he does not have angina on a regular basis and
that his pain is pleuritic in nature.  He denies
palpitations, shortness of breath, edema, any long trips or
recent surgeries.  He does report a sedentary lifestyle.  He
has a history of right lower extremity clot times 2, which
was treated at the [**Hospital1 5808**] Hospital with Coumadin for
6 months each.  His last clot was greater than 5 years ago.
The patient initially presented to an outside hospital today
with a chest pain.  He was started on a nitroglycerin drip,
heparin and Integrilin.  He was transferred directly to the
Catheterization Lab at [**Hospital1 83**] for immediate cardiac
catheterization.

ALLERGIES:  IBUPROFEN, PATIENT GETS HIVES; however, he is
able to tolerate aspirin.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. OxyContin 40 mg by mouth 2 times a day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily.
3. Lipitor dose unknown.
4. Lisinopril dose unknown.
5. Atenolol dose unknown.
The patient's last treatment with Coumadin was greater than 5
years ago.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of right lower extremity DVT
times 2.
Lower back pain with sciatica and herniated disc with chronic
pain, on narcotics.
LAD stent 3 years ago with myocardial infarction, treated at
[**Hospital1 5808**] Hospital.
Right femur fracture as a child in [**2723**].  Has chronic lower
extremity asymmetry.
Long-term smoker.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired post office worker.
He is currently unemployed and debilitated with his lower
back pain.  He reports a [**3-15**]-pack-per-day smoking history
over the last 30-40 years.  This is approximately a 90-to-120-
pack-year history.  He drinks socially but ""not everyday.""
His last beer was 1:30 p.m. at the barbecue prior to his
admission.  He denies any drug use.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes, father died at age 60
of myocardial infarction.  No family history of clotting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4 degrees, blood
pressure 155/89, pulse 55, respirations 20, 97 percent on
room air.  The patient is a heavy-set gentleman in no acute
distress.  His extraocular movements are intact.  He had
anicteric sclerae.  Mucous membranes were moist.  JVP was to
8 cm.  He was clear to auscultation.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His groin
looked clean, dry and intact.  He was examined postcath and
had no bruits but a small hematoma on the right cath site.
Abdomen was distended and obese but nontender and no masses.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  White count 9, hematocrit
40, platelets 185. Sodium 131, potassium is 4.1, creatinine
0.5, BUN 5, CPK 132, MB not done, troponin less than 0.01.

EKG showed normal axes, intervals, ST greater than 2 mm in V2
and V3, no T-wave changes, and questionable flattening in V5,
V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient proceeded directly to the
Cardiac Catheterization Lab.  His LMCA had mild disease, his
LAD had mild diffuse disease, his left circumflex is widely
patent with 30 percent ostial stenosis.  His RCA was heavily
calcified with eccentric 70 percent stenosis and it was
stented with a Taxus drug-eluting stent.  The patient was
transferred to the CMED Service in stable condition.  He
still had chest pain with some pleuritic component.  Given
patient's history of DVT, and his sedentary lifestyle, and
the fact that his chest pain was not completely relieved by
stenting, patient proceeded to chest CT angiogram to rule out
pulmonary embolism.  The patient did not have a pulmonary
embolism.  His chest pain was relieved overnight.  He did
have minor ooze at his cath site and was not compliant with
bed rest.  He was started on cardiac medications prior to his
discharge.  The patient insisted on leaving on morning after
catheterization.  It was advised that patient should stay
given the minor ooze in his groin site and given his
intervention less than 12 hours previous to this request.
The patient insisted on leaving and said he would pull his
own IVs out if we did not let him go.  He assured us he would
follow up with his primary care physician and his
cardiologist within 1 week of discharge.  He was told that if
he had any recurrent chest pain or increased oozing at his
catheterization site, that he needed to return to the
emergency room or call his primary care doctor immediately.
The patient expressed understanding of this and insisted on
going home.  The patient understands he is at risk for
bleeding.  After a long discussion with the attending
resident intern, the patient continued to demand to leave.
The patient signed his AMA form and said he will follow up at
[**Hospital1 5809**] and Cardiology on Tuesday.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease status post
right coronary artery stent.
Hypertension.
Long tobacco history.
Chronic back pain, on narcotics.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily.
2. Plavix 75 mg by mouth daily.
3. Oxycodone sustained-release 40 mg by mouth 2 times a day.
   Please note there was no prescription given for this
   narcotic.
4. Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth daily.
5. Lisinopril 20 mg by mouth daily.
6. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth daily.

     INDICATION:  Chest pain, history of DVT x 2, status post cath.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
     the chest before and after administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast.
     Nonionic Optiray contrast was used for rapid bolus technique.  Coronal and
     sagittal reformations were also obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  The visualized pulmonary arteries are well opacified and
     demonstrate no intraluminal filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism.
     Note is made of coronary artery calcifications.  The heart, pericardium and
     great vessels are otherwise unremarkable.  There are no pathologically-
     enlarged axillary or mediastinal nodes.  There are several prominent right
     hilar nodes, measuring roughly 1.2 cm in short axis.  There are no pleural
     effusions. There are minor dependent changes in the lungs bilaterally. The
     visualized portions of the upper abdomen including the liver, gallbladder,
     spleen, splenule and pancreas are unremarkable. Intravenous contrast was seen
     collecting within the gallbladder consistent with the patient's recent
     catheterization.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  The above findings were confirmed with coronal and
     sagittal reformations.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

NEURO: Maintained on Propofol 15mcg/kg/min. At start of shift pt opened eyes to voice, but did not f/c; later, with increased temps, he has been more difficult to arouse, responding only to pain. 
RESP: At end of day shift pt placed back on CMV d/t increased WOB and decreased sats on CPAP/PS. Later, PEEP weaned to 8 and FiO2 to 40% with resultant ABG of 7.37/31/90/19/-5; sats consistently 98-100%. RR low 30's most of the night on settings of CMV .4/500/12/8. Suctioned several times for thick yellow secretions. LS remain coarse t/o.
C-V: Remains hemodynamically stable with HR mostly 70's-80's with a few self-limiting runs of SVT (rate briefly as high as 150's). BP 90's-100's, CVP 15-20. Lytes WNL. 
ID: Spiking temps to 102.5 with rise in WBC to 19.2 (16.9); given Tylenol X 2; no new cx. Cont's on Meropenum; Vanco level pending. 
GU/RENAL: UO 10-50cc/hr; BUN up to 124 (113), but creat down slightly to 4.2 (4.4). 
GI: TF's quickly advanced to previous goal of 80cc/hr with no difficulty. Belly remains benign allowing for ascites; he continues to pass liquid golden-colored stool via mushroom catheter; lactulose held. 
ENDO: Insulin gtt resumed at 2u/hr with TF's; sugars now WNL. 
HEME: Hct down to 26.7 (28.6) with plt stable at 253; coags not sent. Had slight oozing from corners of mouth after mouth care done; no other bleeding noted. 
SKIN: Previously noted excoriation of perineum cleansed and covered with DoubleGard ointment; I am unable to evaluate progress as I have not cared for him before. Pt also has area on R forearm which is weeping yellow fluid. Pt repositioned q2-4 hours on Kinair bed. 
ACCESS: LIJ MLC, L radial a-line. 
SOCIAL: Pt's wife visited; all questions answered. 

A: relatively stable night, though increased temps and WBC are concerning.

P: Plan to try to lighten up and try CPAP again; check vanco level and dose if appropriate; continue to closely follow renal function; observe for evidence of bleeding; family meeting today to determine further course of treatment.

MICU NPN 7AM-7PM:
Events: Episode of RAF 120-160 treated with IV lopressor, temp down to 99.7 on his own, family met with MD team for update.

Neuro: Pt well sedated on propofol at 15mcg/kg/min. Drip decreased to 5mcg for a few hours as requested by team. Pt developed tachycardia/tachypnea and looked uncomfortable so drip increased back to current rate after two hours. Pt does not follow commands but has attempt to open eyes to commands. When drip decreased moved all extremities weakly but not to command.

CV: BP 90-120/50-60. HR 70's NSR most of the time. Episode of RAF with rates 120-150's treated successfully with 5mg IV lopressor. BP fairly stable at that time. K+ 3.7 given 40meq PO. CVP 15-20

Resp: Remains on AC 12, TV 500, FIO2 40% with 5cm peep. Sat is good 97%-100%. Lungs coarse. Suctioned for small amts thick pale yellow secretions. ETT advanced to 25cm at lip which is still 5cm above the carina according to team but is OK for now. Pt breathing over the vent for total RR 26-38 (RR lower now that temp is down).

GI: Seen by nutrition who said the rate on Tube feeds should be 40cc/hr so this was adjusted according to their recommendation. Tolerating tube feeds well. Passing golden liquid stool via mushroom catheter in large amts. Continues on lactulose as ordered.

GU: Foley draining 30-45cc/hr icteric clear urine. Renal still thinking pt may need CVVHD in the next few days if kidney function does not improve.

Skin: Barrier cream applied to red excoriated buttocks. Looks to be unchaged from past few days. Overall edema seems to be decreasing due to pt's large amts of serous weeping form his arms. Continues to require Kinaire bed for skin breakdown.

ID: Temp came down on it's own over the course of the day. Vanco stopped and imipenum due to stop tomorrow. WBC is on the rise however.

Endo: Continues on the insulin drip with rate .5-3u/hr to keep glucose 80-120. Continues to Q1-2hr fingerstick checks.

Social: Family met with our MICU team including attemding, fellow and resident as well as myself and social service just to update them as to his current condition and potential need for dialysis in the near future. Will continue with aggressive plan of care considering his youth and continue to support him fully and hope the renal/liver failure improves given time/support.

Resp:pt has been on TM 70% most of shift, with RR of 24-32 and O2 sats of >98%. He still has a fair amt of secretion, some of which he can couhg up, but still requires deep sx q2hrs. He has denied any SOB. He has had the Paisy Muir valve on and off depending if family members or house staff want to speak to him. 
Status:Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 8215**] spoke with pt regarding his wishes about further care. The pt made it clear that he would want to stop everything and go home to hospice. He says he understands that his prognosis is poor and knows his death is soon. The pt then reinterated that he would not want to cont with Dialysis when his family(wife and son) arrived, so all  witnessed the pt decisions. SW and case management are involved to attempt to possibly get pt home (this is his and his wife's wish) with hospice care in the next few days.
