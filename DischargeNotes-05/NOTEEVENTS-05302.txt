Admission Date:  [**2754-1-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2754-1-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2669-12-7**]       Sex:  F

Service:

This is an 84 -year-old right handed woman with a history of
hypertension who presented with acute onset of left sided
weakness and dysarthria.  The patient recently had a cold and
visited her primary medical doctor on [**2754-1-8**] and was
otherwise doing well.  At around 10:25 on the day of
admission, she suddenly fell to the floor.  No loss of
consciousness, no head trauma.  This was witnessed by the
daughter who ran to help her up.  However, she found the
patient unable to get up, dysarthric with left facial droop.
She called 911 and the patient was brought to [**Hospital3 **] -
[**Hospital 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**] within an hour.

At this time no more history is available other than the
patient had a total right knee replacement and a history of
lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, on Coumadin until
last [**2753-1-29**].  On examination, she was in no acute
distress with flexor posture on the left, left facial droop,
dysarthric.  She was started on a Nipride drip for a
diastolic blood pressure of 110.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Right total knee replacement.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Captopril 25 mg tid,
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg q day, Norvasc 2.5 mg q day, KCL
8 mEq q day, Humibid long-acting 600 mg po bid, amoxicillin
500 mg po bid which was started recently, prior to the
admission, for bronchitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her daughter.  She is a
retired nurse's aide from [**Hospital3 **].  No social risk
factors.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per daughter, had a cold recently and
started amoxicillin and Humibid for the cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 226/106, pulse 84,
respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 98% on room air,
fingerstick 147.  In no acute distress, normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally, no crackles, no wheezes.  Cardiac
is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, no
tachycardia.  Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Rectal examination was deferred.
Extremities: 2+ pulses in her upper extremities, no rashes.

Mental status: she is dysarthric, she can say her name, knows
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  She is totally ignoring her left
hemispace.  Naming is intact to low and high frequency
objects.  Registration and recall is 3 out of 3.  Positive
grasp bilaterally.  Cranial nerves: does not explore left
side, no nystagmus, normal saccades, pupils are equal, round,
and reactive, left facial droop, sensory loss on the left.
Response to thread on the right.

Motor examination: normal tone and bulk on the right, flexor
arm and increased tone on the left lower extremity.  No
tremors or fasciculations, moves to right side spontaneously.
Minimal movement on the left with possible minimal
interphalangeal movement.  Sensory: normal to light touch on
the right, decreased sensation on the left.  Reflexes: normal
2+ and symmetric at biceps, triceps, and brachial radialis on
the right and hyperreflexic at these tendons on the left.  On
the right, could not elicit patellar and Achilles.  Note,
total knee replacement.  On the left, 2+ at the patellar,
absent at the Achilles.  Triple reflection at the left lower
extremities.  Toes downgoing on the right.  Coordination and
gait on the right: good finger-to-nose and finger tap.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent labs and neurologic imaging.
Sodium 135, potassium 3.1, BUN 27, creatinine 1.0.  White
blood cells 5.6, hematocrit 37.8.  PT 12.1, PTT 24.8, INR
1.0.

Preliminary MRI shows restricted diffusion in the inferior
right MCA territory, affecting the cortical and subcortical
structures.  MRA shows absent inferior division of the right
MCA.  Posterior circulation is within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 83 -year-old lady with acute
stroke within the right MCA territory, causing left sided
symptoms.  TPA was administered and the patient was
transferred to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit.  The next
day, the patient's examination improved.  She was able to
follow simple commands, oriented times three.  She was able
to cross the midline to the left, but had left gaze
preference still.  She still had a mild left facial droop
with no anti-gravity in the left upper extremity, but good
effort.  No change in left sided neglect to sensation for
anosognosia.

The patient had a follow up MRI which showed complete
recanalization of both the superior and inferior divisions of
the MRI.  A carotid was done and Dopplers did not show any
significant stenosis.  Transthoracic echocardiogram was done.
Global left ventricular hypokinesis, aortic sclerosis,
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no definite
cardiac source of embolism.

Because of this, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done to
further evaluate for cardiac source of embolism.  This showed
left and right atria dilated, no spontaneous echo contrast
seen or thrombus seen in the body of the left atrium or the
left atrial appendage or the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage.  No atrioseptal defect is seen by 2-D or color
Doppler.  Left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than
55%.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.  There are complex, 4.0 mm, non-mobile atheroma in
the aortic arch and the descending aorta.  The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion.  No pericardial effusion.

Thus, the patient was not deemed a candidate for Coumadin and
was continued on aspirin and transferred out to the floor.
The patient continued to do well.  By [**2754-1-12**], she followed
simple appendicular commands, oriented to name, but not to
place or year.  Her visual fields were full, no extinction to
double simultaneous stimulation.  Still had dysarthric
speech, mostly understandable, and had pronator drift, left
greater than right, but definitely had good anti-gravity
strength.

She did well; however, on the night of [**2754-1-12**], it was found
that she had a fever of 101 F.  The blood cultures were sent,
a chest x-ray was sent, urine was positive for infection, and
she was started on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract
infection.  The follow up urine culture showed E coli which
was sensitive to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.  Thus she was
continued.

Physical Therapy / Occupational Therapy consult was obtained
which deemed the patient a good candidate for rehabilitation.
In addition, Speech and Swallow saw the patient and
recommended thickened liquids and aspiration precautions,
although she was able to swallow without signs and symptoms
of aspiration.  Furthermore, she had a drop in hematocrit
after her TPA, from an admission CBC of 37.  Anemia labs were
sent.  Ferritin is pending at this time, will need to be
followed up.  Her hematocrit is 28 without any evidence of
ischemia.  We elected not to transfuse her as she appeared to
be clinically stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin 500 mg po q day times seven
days, started [**2754-1-14**], hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q day,
aspirin 325 mg po q day, Norvasc 2.5 mg po q day, labetalol
200 mg po bid, magnesium oxide 400 mg po q day times two more
days, Captopril 25 mg po tid, and Colace.  Note, check
hematocrit on Monday, [**2754-1-18**].

FOLLOW UP:  Will follow up with Stroke Clinic.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Right middle cerebral artery stroke.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To go to rehabilitation.
