Admission Date:  [**3339-4-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**3339-4-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**3273-11-30**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Vascular Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Septic gangrene of the left foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old white male
with coronary artery disease, status post CABG/AVR, history
of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal
insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, status post right
femoropopliteal bypass graft, bladder carcinoma, MRSA who
developed ischemic ulcers of the left foot about two months
prior to admission.  The patient had been hospitalized at the
[**Hospital1 75**] in [**3339-1-28**] on the
medical service for a supratherapeutic INR and ischemic left
foot.  Arteriogram done at that time showed that the patient
had nonreconstructable disease.  The patient was discharged
home and followed as an outpatient.

Three weeks prior to admission the patient developed
increasing pain in his left foot.  He presented to the [**Hospital6 794**] where x-rays showed probable osteomyelitis
with air in the soft tissues.  The patient requested a
transfer to the [**Hospital1 75**] for
evaluation and treatment by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1925**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction x 3;
CABG/AVR in [**3332**].  Positive Persantine MIBI study in [**3339-1-28**] led to a transthoracic echocardiogram showing an
ejection fraction of 40%.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**3339-2-11**] showed patent grafts and no intervention was
necessary.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Diabetes mellitus.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A brother died of liver cancer at age 55.
Mother died of brain cancer at age 75.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his
wife.  He is a retired probation officer.  He quit smoking
cigarettes about eight years ago after a 100-pack-year
history.  He occasionally uses alcohol, no drug use.

ALLERGIES:
1. Intravenous contrast caused ATN in [**3339-1-28**].
2. Oxacillin caused a rash.
3. Iron/niacin caused a rash.
4. Percocet and Darvocet caused unknown reaction; tolerates
Dilaudid.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs showed a temperature of
97.9, pulse 86, respiratory rate 30, blood pressure 102/61,
oxygen saturation equals 100%.  General:  Awake, oriented
white male having difficulty finding words.  Chest:  Lungs
clear bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without
murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  Extremities:  Left foot
gangrenous with necrotic ulcer on the plantar surface.

ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 48.7,
hemoglobin 7, hematocrit 22.2, platelet count 757,000, PT
18.2, PTT 42.9, INR 2.2, sodium 137, potassium 5.6, chloride
102, CO2 22, BUN 56, creatinine 2.5, glucose 133, digoxin
2.8.  Urinalysis showed 208 red blood cells, 18 white blood
cells, no epithelial cells, no bacteria, no yeast.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 86.  ST-T wave
changes were present.  Chest x-ray on [**3339-3-8**] showed no
acute pulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the [**Hospital6 794**] on [**3339-4-3**] and admitted to [**Hospital1 74**].  A CT scan without contrast was
done because of the patient's dysarthria and difficulty word
finding.  Head CT showed no acute bleeding and two old
infarcts were present in the middle cerebral artery
territory.
The patient was taken emergently for a guillotine amputation
of his left foot on admission.  The patient was started on
intravenous vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl.  Wound cultures
were sent from the operating room and grew moderate MRSA,
probable Enterococcus and moderate diphtheroids.

Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit.  He was started on intravenous heparin
for anticoagulation for his mechanical valve.  This was done
after the neurology service reviewed the patient's CT scan
and agreed that the patient did not have an acute bleed or
infarct.  The patient's sepsis continued to improve, and on
[**3339-4-8**] the patient underwent completion below the knee
amputation.  At the time of this dictation the patient's
incision is clean, dry and intact.  He does not need any
dressing or knee immobilizer.  He will continue vancomycin
and Zosyn for two more weeks.  He had a PICC line placed in
his left arm on [**3339-4-14**] by interventional radiology.

The patient is awaiting placement in a [**Hospital 1058**]
rehabilitation facility.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1925**] in the office for staple removal approximately one
month after surgery, that is, approximately [**3339-5-11**].  His
INR at the time of dictation is 2.0.  His goal INR for his
heart valve anticoagulation is 2.5 to 3.0.

     INDICATION: Altered mental status.  Coumadin used, evaluate for hemorrhage.
     
     COMPARISON: None
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS: There is no sign of intra or extra-axial hemhorrage. There is a
     large area of hypodensity within the left temporal lobe extending into the
     parietal lobe.  A 2nd, smaller area of hypodensity is noted within the right
     posterior parietal lobe.  The age of these infarctions is likely chronic,
     given the absence of mass effect and the hypodense appearance. There is no
     mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus.  The
     ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with moderate brain atrophy.
     Soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: No sign of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Two areas of
     hypodensity, as described above consistent with chronic infarcts.  Both
     infarcts are in middle cerebral artery territories.   Correlation with
     clinical history- re: neurological deficits would be helpful in confirming the
     chronicity of the lesions.

This SW met with pt and his wife to offer support.  They both express sense of shock and sadness about these events.  Pt was alert and oriented but drifted off during conversation.  This SW talked with them about grieving process and potential application to amputation.  Pt's wife expressed concerned that pt was depressed prior to admission and she is also concerned about her own coping.  They are both open to continued support.  This SW will f/u after weekend.  If pt is not on T-SICU, will refer to floor SW for continued support.  Pt's wife received contact information for this SW and I will be in touch with her regarding other possible resources regarding amputation issues.

     PICC PLACEMENT:
     
     PHYSICIANS:  [**Doctor Last Name 2221**] and [**Doctor Last Name 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] is the attending and was
     supervising the procedure.
     
     INDICATION:  Antibiotics and Heparin.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient's left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual
     sterile manner.  Ultrasound was used to find a patent and compressible left
     basilic vein.  Under sonographic guidance a 21 gauge needle was inserted into
     the left basilic vein and a 0.018 guidewire was advanced into the axillary
     vein under fluoroscopic guidance.  A 5 French sheath was placed without
     difficulty and a longer 0.018 guidewire was exchanged for and was advanced
     into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The distance from the skin puncture
     site to the SVC was measured at 45 cm.  A 5 French dual lumen PICC was
     trimmed to the appropriate length and inserted into the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  The tube was flushed and withdrawn normally.  The position was
     confirmed with a fluoroscopic spot radiograph.  The skin site was cleaned and
     bandaged.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  The
     line is ready for use.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm, 5 French dual lumen PICC through
     the left basilic vein, terminating in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.
