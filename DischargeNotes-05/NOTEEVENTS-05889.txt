Admission Date: [**3482-5-16**]        Discharge Date: [**3482-5-17**]

Date of Birth:  [**3482-5-16**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 11479**] was the 1205 gram product of a 28
week twin gestation born to a 38-year-old G4, P2, now 4
mother.  Pregnancy was notable for maternal chronic
hypertension and late diagnosis of pregnancy (several weeks
ago) because of this mother remained on Biodan/Hct for
hypertension until two weeks ago when pregnancy was
diagnosed.  Diovan relatively contraindicated during
pregnancy.  Noted to have marked oligo of question duration.
Prenatal screens O+, antibody negative.  Hepatitis Surface
antigen negative.  Rubella immune.  GBS unknown.  When seen
at [**Hospital 2**] Hospital on [**3482-5-16**] had non-reassuring pattern
and this in conjungation with other portions of history
prompted transfer to the [**Hospital1 4**]
and cesarean section, no prenatal steroids were provided.

At delivery emerged with decreased tone and respiratory heart
rate in the 50's initially rapid response to bag mask
ventilation, intubated in the delivery room for moderate
distress.  Apgars were 3 and 6, brought to the newborn
intensive care unit after visiting with parents.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Bruised infant, deep furrowed nasal
bridge, left hand with only two diagonal creases, hand spayed
like.  Left wrist with adduction abnormality, all joints
fully mobile.  Hips normal.  Head notable for wide posterior
fontanel and sutures.  No defect.  Flattened simple ears,
rocker bottom feet bilaterally.  Sternum appears normal.
Lungs:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen benign.
Genitalia: Normal preemie female.  Eyes normal.
Neurological:  Notable for decreased tone throughout,
nonfocal.  Anus patent.  Spine intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  [**Known patient lastname 7495**] was intubated in the
delivery room and was placed on high frequency ventilation
upon arrival to the Newborn intensive care unit.  High
frequency ventilation escalated to maximum support a mean
airway pressure of 20, amplitude of 40, Hz 15 requiring 100%
O2 throughout her hospital stay.  Her blood gases required
multiple doses of sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis
and eventually it became apparent that our efforts were
futile and decision was made with the family to remove
support.

Cardiovascular:  Infant was initially on Dopamine 15 mcg per
kg per minute with borderline blood pressures requiring
normal saline boluses.  She developed EKG changes consistent
with hyperkalemia.  She was treated with bicarbonate and
calcium chloride.  She also received packed red blood
cells in attempt to provide more volume and improve
perfusion.  Infant was pronounced dead at 11:33.

Concerns for renal function secondary to examination
findings.  The infant did not pass any urine during her short
life.

Fluid and Electrolytes:  Birthweight was 1205 and the infant
was initially started on 80 cc's per kilo per day of D10-W.
D-sticks were within normal limits ranging from 87 to 105.
Electrolytes demonstrated a potassium of 7.9, sodium 132,
chloride of 105, total Co2 of 8 at which time infant received
calcium bolus and sodium bicarbonate.

Neurological:  Ultrasounds were not performed.  Infant was
provided pain medication of Fentanyl and Morphine to keep
comfortable.

Hematology:  Hematocrit on admission was 35.7, infant did
receive one transfusion of 10 per kilo packed red blood cells
in attempts to increase perfusion.

Infectious Disease:  A
CBC and blood culture obtained.  Infant was started on
Ampicillin and Cefotaxime.

Psychosocial:  The family is involved and was at bedside at
the time of redirection.  They were involved in all decisions
being made.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Infant has expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Extreme premature female, 28 week twin.

Severe respiratory distress syndrome.

Hypoplastic lung.

Status post rule out sepsis with antibiotics.

Profound hypotension.

Hyperkalemia.

Metabolic acidosis.

     CHEST AND ABDOMEN:  This is our initial film on this baby born prematurely at
     28 weeks.  The patient is intubated with the ETT just above the carina.  An
     umbilical venous line has been introduced and ends projected over the liver.
     The lung volumes are low and the lungs are quite opaque compatible with
     hyaline membrane disease.  The bowel gas pattern is grossly normal.

     INDICATIONS:
     
     Comparison is made to previous films from  [**3482-5-16**]. Since that time the lungs
     have become somewhat clear. The patient remains intubated with the
     endotracheal tube above the carina. The umbilic venous line is unchanged in
     position, probably still within the umbilical vein.  There are some new
     lucencies in the left perihilar region. This could either be due to surfacant
     deficiency or early pulmonary interstitial air.

     CHEST:
     
     Since our last exam of 6/22 the lungs have cleared somewhat.  The ETT ends
     above the carina and the umbilical venous catheter remains presumably in the
     umbilical vein.  There is some lucency in the left perihilar region which may
     be due to either differential surfactant effect or peharps early interstitial
     air.

During night has required NS boluses, dopamine infusion and PRBCs for hypotension perfusion. Received second dose of surfactanct, with this Sats into highh 80s and low 90s. MAWP up to 18 and 20. Has received NaHCO3 for metabolic acidosis. THis am had acute event with devlopment of peaked T waves and wide complex bradycardia. Rxed with NaHCO3, CaCL and epinephrine. With this had return to NSR with HR in 110-120 range. Lytes and ABG pending. Have spoken to mother on several occasions during early morning describing critical state of illness and fact that child may not be able to survive. Have offered visit to NICU, but she prefers to wait uyntil father returns to hospital early this am. I spoke wiht him at home this morning to provide similar updates at approx 5 am. After event this am, attempted to call him at home, but he apparently has left as there is no answer there. Mother states he is on his way home.

We continue to provide ICU care as discussed with mother early this am with knowledge that it may not be able to help child survive. We have discussed limiting care if that care appears to be futile.
