                                     FINAL REPORT
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
     
     There is a comparison from [**2960-1-10**].
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  10 days of yellow drainage from rectum evaluate for abscess
     or fistula.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with
     oral contrast only.  The patient has elevated creatinine, which prevented
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS:  Images of the lower thorax demonstrate coronary artery
     atherosclerosis.  There is no pleural effusion.
     
     There is a small hiatal hernia.
     
     The liver has a nodular appearance consistent with the patient's known
     cirrhosis.  Again noted is intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The spleen is
     unremarkable.  The pancreas is atrophic.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     Nonobstructive calculi are present in both kidneys as was seen previously. 
     There are no dilated bowel loops.  There is a large amount of ascites, which
     has increased since the previous exam.  The previously noted fluid collection
     in the soft tissues of the lateral lower thoracic/abdominal wall has resolved.
     A filter is present in the IVC.
     
     CT PELVIS FINDINGS:  There is extensive colonic diverticulosis without
     evidence of diverticulitis.  There is thickening of the distal rectum.  There
     is no focal fluid collection within the rectal vault.  There is large amount
     of ascites in the pelvis.  There is fluid anterior to the rectum.  There is
     calcification of the seminal vesicles consistent with the patient's known
     history of diabetes.  Incidentally noted on this non-IV contrast-enhanced
     study is thrombus in the right common femoral vein.  There is a large amount
     of fluid in the soft tissues of the pelvis.  Bone windows demonstrate
     osteopenia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Rectal wall thickening, but no evidence of abscess within the rectal wall.
     There is a large amount of ascites, which would hide an abscess in the pelvis.
                                                                 (Over)

NDICATION: Low-grade fever and cough.  
 
The lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor, the heart 
size is normal, but demonstrates left ventricular configuration. 
The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is some crowding of 
vessels in the lower lung zones likely related to the low lung 
volumes. A slightly more patchy area of opacity is seen in the 
infrahilar region on the lateral view likely due to crowding of 
vascular structures. No pleural effusions are identified.  
 
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a 
paucity of bowel gas suggesting underlying ascites.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Low lung volumes. No definite pneumonia, but repeat study may 
be helpful to fully exclude basilar pneumonia on this low lung 
volume radiograph.  
2. Probable ascites.  
.  
INDICATIONS: 76-year-old man with renal failure and cirrhosis.  
 
COMPARISONS: Ultrasound from [**2960-2-7**].  
 
TECHNIQUE: Renal ultrasound examination.  
 
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm in length, the left 
10.9 cm. Both kidneys appear normal without stones, masses, or 
hydronephrosis. There is a large amount of ascites, as seen on 
the recent ultrasound as well. The liver is coarse and nodular 
consistent with cirrhosis.  
 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Large amount of 
ascites.  
.
Reason: Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2960-2-18**] 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with NASH cirrhosis s/p GI bleed now requires 
dialysis 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2960-2-18**] 
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 76-year-old man with cirrhosis of the 
liver, status post GI bleed, renal failure, needs temporal 
dialysis catheter placement for hemodialysis.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] 
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1392**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1392**], the attending radiologist, was 
present and supervising throughout the procedure.

After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, 
written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed 
supine on the angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and 
draped in the standard sterile fashion. Ultrasound confirmed the 
right internal jugular vein was patent and compressible. A 
preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name, 
procedure, and the site. 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for 
local anesthesia. Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge 
needle was used to access the right internal jugular vein. A 
0.018 guide wire was placed through the needle under 
fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava. 
The needle was exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath. 
The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 guide wire under fluoroscopic 
guidance with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The 
micropuncture sheath was removed. The venous access was dilated 
by using 12- and 14-French dilators. A 20-cm hemodialysis 
catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the right 
atrium. The wire was removed. Two lumens were flushed, and the 
catheter was secured with skin with sutures.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no 
immediate complications.

During the procedure, two ultrasound films were taken.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 20-cm, temporal 
hemodialysis catheter through right internal jugular vein with 
the tip in the right atrium. The catheter is ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male w/PMHx sx for DM2, HTN, CKD, cirrhosis [**1-10**] NASH vs. 
PSC who presented with acute on chronic renal failure, thought 
[**1-10**] hepatorenal syndrome, complicated by an UGIB from esophageal 
varices. Patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2960-2-15**], with 
banding of esophageal varices and transfusion of 4u pRBC, now 
stable and s/p placement of hemodialysis catheter and has 
dialysis intiiated, also received large volume paracentesis with 
removal of 1.1 L. His clinical status deteriorated due to 
worsening cirrhosis and renal failure, and he was made CMO prior 
to transfer to hospice. 
.  
#. Acute on chronic renal failure. Patient likely had ARF from 
hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by intravascular volume 
depletion from large volume paracentesis done several days prior 
to admission, with contribution from UGIB during his admission. 
Renal ultrasound has been negative for obstruction, urine 
electrolytes [**Location (un) 6494**] sodium c/w HRS, and urine sediment bland. 
Urine eosinophils negative, less concerning for ATN as cause. 
Patient received 500cc NS challenge on day of admission, with no 
improvement in his renal function.  Patient was initiated on 
hemodialysis and received three sessions with minimal 
improvement in renal function. He was placed on nephrocaps, and 
given octreotide and midodrine for treatment of HRS. He was 
given albumin 12.5 mg twice daily. His diuretics were held. 
.
#. GI bleeding. Patient had an episode of coffee grounds emesis 
in the ED, with hx Grade II esophageal varices. He again had an 
episode of upper GI bleeding while on the floor, and was 
transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU, the patient received 2 units of blood and underwent 
gastric banding for variceal bleeds.  He was continued on 
octreotide gtt for 5 days and started on carafate. After the 
banding, pt did not develop any further hematemasis, however, pt 
received two more units for hct drop.  He was started on full 
liquid diet. He was then transferred to the floor, where he was 
stable for the next several days. He had an active T&S, and was 
on protonix and carafate, scheduled for repeat endoscopy two 
weeks later. On day prior to discharge, patient again started 
vomiting up guaiac positive material. KUB showed an ileus, with 
likely vomiting of feculent material mixed with blood. There was 
no indication of active bleeding.  

#. Scrotal edema. Patient c/o pain and tenderness at Foley 
insertion site, and his foley was discontinued. He was not 
having any urine output and received intermittent straight 
catheterizations with minimal urine output. These were 
discontinued as well due to patient discomfort. Bladder scan was

     COMPARISON:  [**2960-1-6**].
     
     INDICATION:  Low-grade fever and cough.
     
     The lung volumes are low.  Allowing for this factor, the heart size is normal,
     but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.  The pulmonary vascularity is
     normal.  There is some crowding of vessels in the lower lung zones likely
     related to the low lung volumes.  A slightly more patchy area of opacity is
     seen in the infrahilar region on the lateral view likely due to crowding of
     vascular structures.  No pleural effusions are identified.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a paucity of bowel
     gas suggesting underlying ascites.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Low lung volumes.  No definite pneumonia, but repeat study may be helpful
     to fully exclude basilar pneumonia given low lung volumes on this radiograph.
     2.  Probable ascites.

      76 year old man with NASH cirrhosis s/p GI bleed now requires dialysis          
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2960-2-18**]                         
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  76-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver, status
     post GI bleed, renal failure, needs temporal dialysis catheter placement for
     hemodialysis.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient, written informed
     consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic
     table.  The right neck was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Ultrasound confirmed the right internal jugular vein was patent and
     compressible.  A preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's
     name, procedure, and the site.  5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia.  Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge needle was used to
     access the right internal jugular vein.  A 0.018 guide wire was placed through
     the needle under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
     The needle was exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath.  The wire was
     exchanged for a 0.035 guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  76-year-old man with renal failure, and cirrhosis.  Suspicion of
     spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  Request for both diagnostic and
     therapeutic paracentesis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Following discussion of the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     informed consent was obtained from the patient.  The procedure was performed
     by Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2198**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2199**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5897**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11365**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2171**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 311**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 311**], the
     attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] present and supervising throughout.  Preprocedure
     timeout was performed.  Using ultrasound guidance, a suitable site for
     paracentesis was marked in the right lower quadrant.  The site was prepped and
     draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Anesthesia was provided locally with 6
     cc of 1% lidocaine.  Peritoneal cavity was entered without difficulty using a
     5-French paracentesis needle, and samples were aspirated for chemistry, cell
     count, Gram stain, and culture and sent to the laboratory.  1.1 liters of
     straw fluid was then removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well. 
     There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, with removal
     of 1.1 liters of ascites fluid.
