History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old male transfered to [**Hospital1 83**] from an 
OSH for STEMI, in cardiogenic shock on pressors.

Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3452-7-18**] with SOB 
and chest pain of approximately 1 wk duration. In OSH ED, was 
found to have RML PNA. He also reported fall one week prior with 
facial ecchymosis, found to have nasal fx by CT. EKG showed 
sinus tach in the 130s with Qs in II,III,aVF with nl. axis and 
intervals and T-waves inverted in inferior leads and ST 
depressions in the lateral leads. Pt received ASA, b-blockers, 
morphine, nitro paste, levaquin and was pain-free with sats in 
the 90%s on 100%NRB. Troponin was 0.525 with flat CK. T max 
99.1. WBC 15.9, Hct 44.5%. Received lovenox sq, with last dose 
at 12am [**3452-7-19**].   
On [**7-19**] at noon, pt became SOB and diaphoretic with pain, and 
sats fell to 77% on 100%NRB with HR120. Received 40mg of lasix, 
4mg morphine, and was intubated at 12:30pm. At 1pm, EKG showed 
sinus at 100, nl intervals and axis with Qs in III & aVF, ST 
elevations in III>II, and ST depressions in I,aVL. Blood 
pressure fell s/p intubation to 60s/20s requiring fluid 
resuscitation and dopamine 10mcg/kg/min. O2 sats rose to 88% on 
AC700mlx14/min + 5PEEP. CXR showed worsening of a R lung 
alveolar process with extrusion to the L side, with a 
differential of infection vs R>L pulmonary edema.  Patient was 
then transferred to [**Hospital1 83**].

CATH [**3452-7-19**]: LMCA had a 40% lesion. LAD had diffuse luminal 
irregularities but was free of significant stenoses and supplied 
2 moderate-sized diagonal branches which were also free of 
significant disease. LCX had a hazy 60% lesion in the mid 
vessel and a hazy 80% lesion in the distal vessel. The RCA was a 
small 
vessel and was totally occluded in the mid segment. A R-PDA was 
seen 
filling via L-R collaterals. Resting hemodynamics revealed 
evidence of cardiogenic shock with an aortic pressure of 94/53 
mmHg, a cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/m2 and a 
PCWP of 30 mmHg on an infusion of dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min. 
stented 
with a 3.5 x 13 mm cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7039**] and 3.0 x 13 mm cypher 
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] 
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7040**] at 14 atms with no residual stenosis, no dissection and 
timi 3 
flow.  

Transthoracic Echo [**3452-7-20**]:
EF 70% The overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal 
(borderline  
hyperdynamic) but the lateral wall and adjacent segments of 
anterior free wall  
are hypokinetic relative to the frankly hyperdynamic inferior 
and posterior  
walls. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. 
There is a  
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  
  
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of 
[**3452-7-19**], the cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with ventricular 
tachycardia;  
the lateral wall (which now appears relatively hypokinetic) was 
not  
well-visualized on the prior study; therefore no direct 
comparison of  
contractile function in this territory can be made.  

Transesophageal Echo [**3452-7-20**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left  
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial  
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Left  
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function 
are normal  
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal.  
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are 
normal in diameter  
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear  
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is  
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral 
leaflets are  
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe posterior mitral leaflet 
prolapse. There  
is partial mitral leaflet flail. There is moderate thickening of 
the mitral  
valve chordae. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU service after his 
catheterization. Overall the following weeks the pt was 
determined to be extremely sick with multiple organ system 
failure. He needed a mitral valve replacement surgery, however, 
in order to have this surgery he would need to be extubated and 
afebrile. He was treated with hemodialysis and further diuresis 
was attempted with IV diuretics and BNP, however the pt's 
respiratory status remained tenuous. Furthermore, he did not 
wake up when sedation was weaned. He was evaluated by Neuro with 
an EEG that showed only diffuse slowing and a head CT that 
showed no acute changes. It was felt likely that due to his 
episodes of hypotension with the VT and other hemodynamic 
instability later that he had sustained anoxic brain injury. 
This was all discussed with the family who felt that the pt 
would not have wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator long-term 
when any hope of recovery was extremely slim. As all attempts to 
wean him from the ventilator were unsuccessful he was made CMO 
and made comfortable with morphine. He died shortly after.

     INDICATIONS:  Status post intubation and transfer from outside hospital for
     pneumonia.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to digitized images from an outside
     hospital.  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position several
     centimeters above the carina.  The cardiac size is at the upper limits of
     normal.  There are bilateral pulmonary parenchymal opacities, which initially
     began in the right lower lobe, and subsequently involved the whole right lung
     and the central portion of the left lung.  On the current study, there is a
     clearing of the right lower lobe opacity, but increased opacity in both upper
     lobes.  While pneumonia is on the differential diagnosis, the rapid change in
     appearance is likely due to aspiration.  There is collapse/consolidation of
     the left lower lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with pneumonia. Given
     the rapid change on multiple serial films, aspiration is in the differential
     diagnosis.

     HISTORY:  Abdominal distention, question obstruction.
     
     FINDINGS:  This is a single portable supine film that shows diffuse hazy
     increased opacity over the abdomen.  It is unclear if this is due to patient
     body habitus or ascites.  Gas is seen in the nondistended transverse and
     descending colon but otherwise there is a paucity of bowel gas.  The
     diaphragms are off the film.  There is no upright film.  A catheter overlies
     the expected region of the right common iliac vein and IVC with the tip off
     the film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

     INDICATION: Pneumonia, flail mitral leaflet. Patient intubated. Check status.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP supine view. Comparison study taken [**7-25**] in semi-
     upright position. The right subclavian Swan catheter remains in good position
     with its tip in the right pulmonary artery. ETT is also in satisfactory
     position with its tip below the thoracic inlet. NG line extends into the lower
     portion of the stomach. The heart shows slight LV enlargement. There is again
     evidence of some LV enlargement of the heart associated with bilateral pleural
     effusions and left lower lobe collapse/consolidation behind the heart. The
     pulmonary vessels show slight upper zone redistribution.
     
     IMPRESSION: The findings are consistent with resolving left heart failure. The
     lines are well positioned. Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation noted.

     venous line.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to a prior study from the same day. There is a
     new right IJ central venous line which terminates within the mid-SVC.  A left
     subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter is in place which terminates within the distal
     right pulmonary artery.  The heart size and mediastinal contours are
     unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Slight failure appears
     unchanged when compared to the prior examination with stable bilateral
     effusions and opacity at the left lung base.  An NG tube terminates 6 cm above
     the carina.  An NG tube passes beneath the diaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of a right IJ central venous line which
     terminates within the SVC with no evidence of pneumothorax.  A left sided SG
     catheter terminates in a distal location within a right pulmonary artery.
     Otherwise unchanged exam when compared to a previous study from the same day.

     TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed after IV contrast.
     No IV contrast was administered secondary to patient renal dysfunction.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Atelectasis and/or consolidation is
     present within the visualized portions of the posterior lung bases with small
     bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a likely Swan-Ganz catheter in place
     with its distal tip within the mid-right pulmonary artery.  A small amount of
     pericardial fluid or thickening is present.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
     spleen, and adrenal glands are normal in this study limited by lack of IV
     contrast.  Non-specific stranding surrounds both kidneys with no evidence of
     renal stone or hydronephrosis.  No dilatation or wall thickening is seen
     within the large or small bowel. The abdominal aorta is ectatic in appearance.
      The abdominal aorat measures 3.4 x 3.4 cm in greatest transverse dimension.
     There is no evidence of free air, free fluid, or intra-abdominal abscess.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is unremarkable with a
     Foley catheter in place. The prostate gland and rectum are normal in
     appearance.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Atelectasis and/or infiltrates within the visualized portions

     PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY:  Comparison made to study from [**3452-8-3**].  The tip of
     the right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen, and has been withdrawn, but
     continues to be positioned in an interlobar branch of the right pulmonary
     artery.  NG tube is seen extending beyond the imaged fiel.  ET tube is seen
     approximately 5-6 cm above the carina.  There is increased diffuse bilateral
     patchy opacities, representing worsening CHF.  Mediastinal contours are
     unchanged from previous exam.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval repositioning of the right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter, the
     tip of which is still positioned in the interlobar branch of the right
     pulmonary artery.  Worsening CHF compared to previous exam.  Results called to

     replacement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3452-8-4**].
     
     FINDINGS:  AP portable supine view.  The endotracheal tube remains in
     unchanged position.  The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter terminates
     in the right interlobar artery, and it should be pulled back by 6-7 cm.  This
     was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13584**] at 1:40 PM on [**3452-8-5**].
     
     There is increased left perihilar opacity, consistent with worsening
     pneumonia.  There is a persistent right perihilar and right lower lobe
     opacity, also consistent with pneumonia.  There is persistent left lower lobe
     atelectasis.  There is increased pulmonary vascularity, consistent with mild
     pulmonary edema.  Degenerative changes are again noted in the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right interlobar pulmonary
     artery, and it should be pulled back by 6-7 cm.
     
     2.  Worsening multifocal pneumonia.
     
     3.  Mild congestive heart failure.
