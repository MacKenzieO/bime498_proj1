Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2632**] 
Chief Complaint:
Transfered from [**Hospital6 6071**] for Left Periprosthetic femur 
fracture
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open Reduction Internal Fixation of Left periprosthetic Femur 
Fracture ([**2986-1-10**])

 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89 yo lady w/ h/o HTN, RA, who was admitted on [**2986-1-7**] 
s/p multiple falls at her nursing home, which resulted in Left 
peri-prosthetic femur fracture. She had an initial Left hip 
fracture after mechanical fall on [**2985-12-16**]. At that time, she 
was seen at [**Hospital 486**] Hospital where a L hip hemiarthroplasty 
was done. By report, post op course c/b anemia and oversedation. 
She was d/[**Street Address 6072**] Nursing Home on [**12-21**], and since then, 
she has continued to have multiple falls, now leading to 
fracture at prosthesis site.  
Upon admit [**1-7**], patient had stable VS with mild tachy, but was 
noted to be confused. She was given morphine for pain control. 
She had a negative head CT, CTA neg for PE (but CT chest showed 
9x5 mm left lingular nodule and COPD). Her femur films showed 
fracture of proximal left femur immediately distal to distal tip 
of prosthesis w/ medial displacement and slight anterior 
angulation of distal fracture fragment. She was partially 
reduced by ortho in ED and placed in traction with plan for O.R 
when clinically stable. She was noted to have sinus tach to 
100's, thought to be due to pain/hypovolemia. Given admission 
hct of 24.9 (from baseline 34), she was thus admitted to FICU 
for hct watch and close monitoring. She was guiac negative but 
team was concerned for thigh vs RP collection.They were unable 
to get CT w/ leg in traction but hct stabalized. She rec'd three 
units of prbc's pre op and went to O.R. on [**2986-1-10**] for ORIF of 
left hip prosthetic fracture. EBL 800 cc. She has received a 
total of 7 units of prbc's to date (4 in last 24 hrs).  
Post op last night, pt noted to be hypotensive to 90's and 
tachycardic to 100's with decreased UOP. She was thought to be 
in AF, started on amio gtt, lopressor, then neosynehphrine was 
started as well. There was concern for post op bleeding and CT 
scan of surgical site completed w/o evidence of bleed. CTA also 
done given A-a gradient and tachycardia post op. Swan floated 
through RIJ. Has femoral A line. She remains intubated currently 
and her BP, HR have normalized. She is sedated. SICU team 
requested transfer to MICU service.

.
Diagnostic Studies:
[**2986-1-6**] RIGHT FEMUR, THREE VIEWS
Again seen is a fracture of the proximal femur immediately 
distal to the distal tip of the prosthesis. There is medial 
displacement, bandaging, and slight anterior angulation of the 
distal fracture fragment, however, this appears to be improved 
in position in comparison to prior study.  
.  
[**2986-1-6**] CTA:  
1. No pulmonary embolism.  
2. There is a 9 X 5-mm nodule within the left lingula. Given the 
patient's underlying extensive emphysematous disease and the 
appearance of the nodule, we suggest obtaining prior studies 
from elsewhere for comparison. In the absence of this, 
short-term followup should be obtained in two months' time to 
evaluate for interval change. Small bronchogenic neoplasm cannot 
be excluded.  
3. There is a hiatal hernia. Given the appearance of this, with 
a lack of intraluminal air and the soft tissue prominence, 
correlation to barium swallow study is suggested.  
.
CT Head [**2986-1-6**]
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles are 
symmetric, there is no shift of normally midline structures. 
There are multiple areas of decreased attenuation within the 
periventricular subcortical white matter, consistent with 
chronic small-vessel ischemic infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter 
differentiation is preserved. Minimal mucosal thickening is 
noted within the right maxillary sinus. No air-fluid levels are 
seen. The soft tissue structures are otherwise normal. No 
fractures are identified.
.
CT Head [**2986-1-12**]
The study is limited secondary to significant motion. Within the 
left frontal lobe, there is an area of decreased attenuation, 
involving both the [**Doctor Last Name **] and white matter in the distribution of 
the left MCA artery, and likely represents an area of recent 
infarction. The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift 
of normally midline structures. There is decreased attenuation 
in the periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic 
small vessel ischemic infarction.
There is bilateral mastoid opacification, and mild mucosal 
thickening in the right maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.
No definite areas of intracranial hemorrhage are seen.
.
[**2986-1-13**] EEG
This is a normal portable EEG. No lateralizing or 
epileptiform abnormalities were seen. Frequent ventricular 
ectopies 
with couples were seen. 
.
[**2986-1-13**] Carotid US
Atherosclerotic plaque is present in the carotid arteries 
bilaterally as described above. There is no significant carotid 
stenosis (evaluated as less than 40% stenosis bilaterally).

 
Brief Hospital Course:
89 y/o female who was admitted on [**2986-1-6**] for treatment of left 
periprosthetic femur fracture after a fall. Initial workup ruled 
out PE and stroke. She was found to have first degree heart 
block on EKG. CT of head revealed evidence of chronic small 
vessel infarcts. She was treated by the FICU team and eventually 
transfered to the SICU service after ORIF of left femur by 
orthopedics on [**2986-1-10**]. Post op she was hypotensive and 
tacycardic requiring pressors, swan ganz catheter, and 
antiarrythmia agents for suspected AFib. A CTA ruled out PE. She 
was subsequently transfered to the MICU service for management 
of hypotension and arrhythmia. She received fluids, was weaned 
from pressors, and was stabilized.  Swan ganz was removed. She 
was slow to recover from sedation and had a CT of the head which 
revealed subacute left frontal stroke. Neurology was consulted 
and she had repeat head CT which was unchanged, her SBP was kept 
>120, blood sugars were tightly controled, and fevers were 
minimized with tylenol. Echo showed normal LVEF, Carotid US 
showed less than 40% Stenosis bilaterally, EEG was negative for 
seizures. She was started on coumadin 4mgQHS for 
anticoagulation. Her unresponsiveness continued and workup for 
toxic metabolic cause was unreveiling. She was taken off any 
sedating medications and pain treated with tylenol. Through 
discussions with the family concerning the patient's wishes, she 
was made DNR/DNI and eventually the goals of care were changed 
to comfort measures only. She was extubated on [**2986-1-19**] and 
expired on [**2986-1-22**].

     INDICATION:  History of femur fracture, with sinus tachycardia.  Evaluate for
     pulmonary embolism.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     thoracic inlet to the lung bases.  Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
     
     CONTRAST:  80 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
     rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defects or pulmonary emboli identified within
     the pulmonary arteries to the level of the segmental branches bilaterally.
     Extensive calcification is seen of the aorta, without any evidence of
     dissection or aneurysmal dilatation.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Soft tissue window images demonstrate no
     pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. There
     is a hiatal hernia immediately proximal to the GE junction, with no definite
     intraluminal air identified in the distal portion.  Additionally, this soft
     tissue appears slightly prominent.  No pleural effusions are seen. The heart
     and pericardium are normal in appearance.  Lung window images demonstrate
     extensive emphysematous change within both lungs bilaterally. Additionally,
     within the left lingula, there is a 5 x 9-mm nodule.  Several other tiny
     nodules are noted peripherally.  Focal scarring is noted at the right lung
     base.  The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     The limited visualized areas of the superior portions of the liver, spleen,
     stomach, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating
     the anatomy and pathology.

      89 year old woman with hip surgery                                              
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      acute postsurgical bleeding                                                     
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  89-year-old woman status post hip surgery with hypotension.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural
     effusions with adjacent areas of atelectasis.  Within the limitations of a
     non-contrast examination, the liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands
     appear normal.  The right kidney shows a homogeneous 6 mm - diameter
     hyperdense cyst, likely slightly complex renal cyst.  In the left kidney,
     there is a 24 mm diameter unilocular cystic lesion with fluid-like density,
     probably a simple renal cyst.  However, enhancement characteristics cannot be
     evaluated on this study.
     
     There is diffuse mesenteric edema and ascites within the pelvis.  There is no
     evidence of free air, or lymphadenopathy.  The aorta and iliac arteries show
     mural calcifications.  The gallbladder is quite distended, which could be seen
     in a fasting state.  The right inguinal canal contains a hydrocele with fluid-
     like density.  There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST.  There is extensive diverticulosis, and
     ascites.  A Foley catheter is present in the bladder.  The limited view of the
     uterus is unremarkable.  There is no pelvic adenopathy.
     
     The region surrounding the left hip is obscured by streak artifact from the
     left total hip prosthesis and lateral fixation plate and transverse screws,
     which were not fully evaluated here.  However, the left leg is diffusely
     edematous, greater than on the right side.  Lateral to the left hip is a small
     low-density fluid collection with subcutaneous air.  More distally, there is a
     drain which terminates posterior to the left femur.
     
     There is no evidence of a large hematoma to explain major blood loss by
     imaging, however.  Bilaterally, there is fluid in the visualized superolateral
     portion of the knee joint. There are vascular calcifications seen bilaterally.
     There is diffuse anasarca.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The patient is status post left total hip prosthesis and ORIF
     of left femur.  Some fracture lines remain visible, but the alignment appears
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from [**2986-1-7**].
     
     Four intraoperative images were performed without a radiologist present. These
     demonstrate placement of a lateral plate with multiple cortical screws and
     cerclage wires through a fracture at the distal aspect of the femoral
     prosthetic component.  There is good anatomic alignment.  Would refer to the

     INDICATION:  Femur fracture.  Persistently sinus tachycardia despite pain
     control and IV fluids.  Aa gradient.  Please evaluate for PE.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated [**2986-1-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained without
     contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray,
     contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained during opacification
     of the pulmonary artery.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary arteries
     and branches to suggest pulmonary embolus.  The aorta is of normal caliber,
     there is no dissection present.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There are moderate to large
     bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a small pericardial effusion. The
     pericardial effusion tracks up around the pulmonary veins, and there may be
     mild pressure effect on these veins. Effusions are new compared to [**1-7**]. There is associated bibasilar atelectasis within the lungs. An
     endotracheal tube is in place, with the tip at the thoracic inlet. There are
     emphysematous changes. There is ground glass opacity within both lung fields
     consistent with pulmonary edema. The previously described nodule of the left
     lingula is again seen.  It is less well defined on today's exam, as are other
     tiny previously noted nodules, given the degree of pulmonary edema present.
     The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     Extensive aortic calcification is again noted. No pathologically enlarged
     axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes are seen on this exam.  A moderate
     to large hiatal hernia is again seen. There is anasarca of the soft tissues.
     
     Within the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, the imaged portions of the
     liver and spleen are unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a hemangioma of the lower thoracic vertebral body.
     Degenerative changes are again noted.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case (grade 1).
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
                                                                 (Over)

     2.  Pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and
     edema of the soft tissues. The pericardial effusion may be exerting pressure
     effect on the pulmonary veins, raising the possibility of an element of
     constrictive pericarditis.
     3.  Nodule within the left lingula again seen.  Again neoplasm is not
     excluded.
     4.  Extensive emphysematous disease.
     5.  Hiatal hernia as previously described.
