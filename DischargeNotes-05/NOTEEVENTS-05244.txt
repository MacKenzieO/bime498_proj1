                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with malpositioned PICC line placed at the
     bedside.  Repositioning requested.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PICC line revision.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2198**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2199**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 156**] performed the
     procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The patient arrived with a PICC line in the upper
     right arm, which had been placed at the bedside.  A fluoroscopic spot view
     showed that this line was malpositioned, heading upward into the right
     internal jugular vein. The site of line entry was prepped and draped in the
     usual sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify the
     procedure to be performed and the identity of the patient.  Under fluoroscopic
     guidance, the PICC line was retracted back into the right subclavian vein, and
     via the existing PICC line, 0.018 guidewire was passed into the superior vena
     cava.  The existing PICC line was then removed and replaced by a 4.5 French
     micropuncture sheath.  Via the guidewire and sheath, a 37-cm length 4 French
     single-lumen PICC line was advanced into the superior vena cava under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  A final fluoroscopic spot image shows the new catheter
     terminating in the distal superior vena cava.  The line was flushed and
     secured to the adjacent skin with a StatLock device.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful replacement of existing PICC line with a 37-cm length
     4 French PICC line, via the pre-existing intravenous access site in the right
     upper arm, terminating in the superior vena cava.  Line ready for use.

     ONE PORTABLE VIEW:  Comparison with previous study done earlier the same day.
     Persistent atelectasis or consolidation at the left base.  Subtly increased
     density at the right base may represent a developing infiltrate on that side.
     The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  A PICC line has been
     adjusted and now terminates in the right chest in the region of the upper
     portion of the superior vena cava.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Elevated LFTs and diffuse abdominal pain, evaluate for
     cholecystitis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
     without oral or intravenous contrast and displayed in 5 mm axial collimation.
     Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also obtained.  Comparison is
     made to right upper quadrant ultrasound performed approximately two hours
     prior.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are large bibasilar opacities that likely
     represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.  There is a small
     left pleural effusion.  There are dense coronary artery calcifications and
     aortic valvular calcifications.  Calcified subcarinal lymph nodes are noted.
     The thoracic aorta is tortuous.  Allowing for limitations in a non-contrast
     study, the liver appears normal.  Multiple granulomas are present in the
     spleen.  The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel loops are normal.  The
     adrenal glands are normal.  Innumerable lesions are present within both
     kidneys, some demonstrating rim calcification.  The renal cortices are
     atrophied.  Multiple mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted, the
     largest measuring 10 mm inferior to the pancreas.  There is near total fatty
     replacement of the pancreas.
     
     The gallbladder is distended with pericholecystic stranding.  The wall cannot
     be assessed.  There is a small amount of free fluid about the liver.
     
     There is an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.4 cm in diameter and 4 cm in
     length, located 5 cm below the renal arteries, and not extending to the iliac
     branches.  The abdominal aorta is very tortuous at this site.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The rectum, large bowel appear normal.  Scattered
     diverticula are noted within the sigmoid colon.  Foley is present within the
     bladder.  There is small free fluid in the pelvis.  There is a fat-containing
                                                                 (Over)

     PROCEDURE:  After explaining potential risks and benefits of the procedure to
     the patient's wife by telephone, verbal consent was obtained.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 291**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5658**] served as witness.  Patient identity was confirmed by name and date of
     birth.  A qualified nurse was present to administer 50 mg of fentanyl over a
     30-minute period with appropriate monitoring.
     
     The right upper abdomen was prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     1% lidocaine buffered with bicarbonate was injected into the skin and
     subcutaneous tissues for local anesthesia.  Thereafter, utilizing ultrasound
     guidance, an 8-French pigtail catheter was inserted directly into the
     gallbladder.  There was a free return of bile.  The gallbladder was
     decompressed with suction (approximately 300 cc.) and specimens were sent for
     culture and Gram stain. The catheter was then connected to the bag to drain
     dependently. The patient tolerated the procedure and no immediate
     complications were observed. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 370**] was present for all essential portions
     of the procedure.

     Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
     vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
     Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
     establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
     guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 33 cm was then placed through
     the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film of
     the chest.
     
     The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
     secured to the skin, flushed and the sterile dressing applied.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post percutaneous cholecystostomy with persistent
     nausea and failure to thrive.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  0.625-mm helically acquired images are obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis with intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar
     reformations are provided for interpretation.
     
     FINDINGS:  Direct comparison is made to prior examination dated [**2832-8-31**].
     
     There is a large right-sided pleural effusion with areas of adjacent passive
     atelectasis.  This is increased since the prior exam.  Minimal left-sided
     pleural fluid is identified, again with areas of basilar atelectasis.
     
     The gallbladder demonstrates moderate wall thickening, but does not appear to
     be distended.  No pericholecystic fluid collections are identified.  Overall,
     the appearance is significantly improved since the aforementioned prior exam. 
     Multiple calcifications are identified within the spleen consistent with prior
     granulomatous infection.  Liver, adrenal glands appear stable.  40-mm cystic
     lesion identified within the body of the pancreas.  Overall, this appears
     unchanged since the prior exam.
     
     Bilateral renal cysts are again identified as previously noted.
     
     Abdominal aortic ectasia is again seen.
     
     Bowel appears grossly unremarkable.  Pelvic structures are grossly normal.  No
     lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is evidence of gallbladder wall thickening.  However, the
     gallbladder does not appear to be distended and does appear significantly
     improved since the aforementioned prior examination.  No evidence of
     pericholecystic fluid collection.
     2.  Increase in size in right-sided pleural effusion is noted.
     3.  Cystic pancreatic lesion which is unchanged since prior study.
     4.  Bilateral renal cysts as noted.

     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3781**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Doctor Last Name 156**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the Attending
     Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
     vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
     Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
     establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
     guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 33 cm was then placed through
     the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic
     guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film of
     the chest.
     
     The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
     secured to the skin, flushed and the sterile dressing applied.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double lumen
     PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.  Final internal
     length is 33 cm,  with tip positioned in the SVC.  The line is ready to use.
