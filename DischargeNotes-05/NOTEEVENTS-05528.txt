                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, right lung mass.
     
     CHEST:  No previous films available for comparison.
     
     The cardiac size is within normal limits.  A mass is seen in the right lower
     lobe, which measures 4.7 cm in diameter.  An associated right pleural effusion
     is present.  Additionally, a further rounded mass is present in the left mid
     zone, which measures 2.9 cm in diameter.  The presence of two masses suggest
     that the cause may be metastatic disease rather than primary lung disease. 
     Further evaluation prior to operation is therefore suggested if possible.

     INDICATION:  83 y/o man with coronary artery disease, right lung mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.
     
     COMPARISON:  Made to prior chest x-ray dated [**3478-1-12**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged compared to the
     prior study.  Again note is made of right pleural effusion, which appears
     slightly increased compared to the prior study, associated with some
     atelectasis.  Again note is made of right lower lobe mass, measuring 5 x 6 cm
     in diameter on the lateral view.  Also note is made of 2 cm left upper lobe
     nodular lesion.  No CHF is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Persistent bilateral lung mass as described above, measuring 5 x
     6 cm in right lower lobe, with increased effusion.  The presence of the mass
     and effusion is concerning for neoplastic process, either metastatic disease
     or lung cancer with local metastases.  As commented on the previous report,
     further evaluation, especially by chest CT is recommended.

     INDICATION:  S/P CABG presenting with fever. R/o mediastinitis. 
     
     COMPARISON:  No CT's are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A-MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained with IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to the volume necessary for this study.  5
     cc of Optiray 350 were used.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy.  There is a
     small amount of air in mediastinum and in subcutaneous tissues under the
     incision. There is a fluid collection in the anterior mediastinal that
     measures 2.4 x 2.3 cm (if the surgery was more than 7 days presumably on
     [**3478-1-15**]), this may represent an abscess.  There is also stranding of
     this fat in the anterior mediastinum.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The
     edema appears to be patent.  Other bypasses also appear to be patent. Multiple
     surgical clips seen in the mediastinum.
     
     There are bilateral noncalcified pleural plaques which could represent prior
     asbestos exposure.  There are no pleural effusions.  The lung windows
     demonstrate an intrapulmonary fluid collection with air in the right lower
     lobe measuring 4.5 x 3.0 cm.  There is associated atelectasis in that area.
     Did the patient have surgical resection of the lung mass?  Correlate this with
     prior imaging modalities.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen do not demonstrate significant
     abnormality.  The adrenal glands are normal.  No evidence of liver masses.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.  There is no
     evidence of paraspinal masses.
     
     IMPRESSION:

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  S/P CABG presenting with fever. R/o mediastinitis. 
     
     COMPARISON:  No CT's are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A-MDCT axial images of the chest were obtained with IV contrast.
     Nonionic IV contrast was used due to the volume necessary for this study.  5
     cc of Optiray 350 were used.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy.  There is a
     small amount of air in mediastinum and in subcutaneous tissues under the
     incision. There is a fluid collection in the anterior mediastinal that
     measures 2.4 x 2.3 cm (if the surgery was more than 7 days presumably on
     [**3478-1-15**]), this may represent an abscess.  There is also stranding of
     this fat in the anterior mediastinum.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The
     edema appears to be patent.  Other bypasses also appear to be patent. Multiple
     surgical clips seen in the mediastinum.
     
     There are bilateral noncalcified pleural plaques which could represent prior
     asbestos exposure.  There are no pleural effusions.  The lung windows
     demonstrate an intrapulmonary fluid collection with air in the right lower
     lobe measuring 4.5 x 3.0 cm.  There is associated atelectasis in that area.
     Did the patient have surgical resection of the lung mass?  Correlate this with
     prior imaging modalities.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen do not demonstrate significant
     abnormality.  The adrenal glands are normal.  No evidence of liver masses.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen.  There is no
     evidence of paraspinal masses.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  If the surgery was on [**1-15**], the findings are suspicious for
     mediastinitis with a fluid collection.
     
     2) There is a fluid collection in the lung parenchyma (RLL) with air within
     it. If the patient had a recent surgical procedure in that area, that could be
     postoperative, if not, this could represent a lung abscess.

     INDICATION:  An 83-year-old man status post CABG, status post sternal
     debridement for mediastinitis.  Please assess for infiltrates or effusions.
     
     Portable AP view of the chest dated [**3478-2-20**] compared with the same
     examination from [**3478-2-14**].  The patient has been extubated.  There has
     been interval placement of at least three mediastinal drains, one overlying
     the midline mediastinum, the other two positioned laterally crossing the lower
     lung lobes.  The left internal jugular central venous catheter remains
     positioned in the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava.
     The previously identified right lower lobe density is not seen well on the
     current examination.  This may have resolved or it may be obscured by an
     overlying drain.  Mediastinum is wide, which is likely secondary to
     postoperative changes.  There is bilateral partial atelectasis of the right
     and left lower lobes.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is no prominence of
     the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary edema.  There is a small right
     pleural effusion; there may be a left pleural effusion, however, the
     costodiaphragmatic angle on this side has been excluded from the film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Bilateral partial atelectasis at the lung _____.
     2.  Status post mediastinal debridement with placement of at least 3
     mediastinal drains, with new widening of the mediastinum, likely secondary to
     postoperative changes.  There is no pneumothorax.

     status post sternal debridement.
     
      PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**3478-2-28**] is compared with the portable
     AP view of the chest from [**3478-2-21**].  There has been  interval removal of
     the left IJ and right subclavian central venous catheters.  Midline
     mediastinal drain, and the drain that  previously lay over the lower right
     hemithorax have been removed.  The drain overlying the left hemithorax remains
     in place.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a 4.0 x 4.9 x 6.1 cm soft
     tissue density within the right lower lobe.  This density contains a cavity
     with an  air fluid level.  There are no other focal opacities.  There is no
     prominence of the pulmonary vasculature to suggest congestive heart failure. 
     There are no pleural effusions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  4 x 5 x 6 cm soft tissue cavitating mass lesion within the right
     lower lobe.  Review of prior chest x-rays and CT of the chest from [**3478-2-13**] show that this lesion has not changed significantly.  No other focal
     opacities to suggest mass or consolidation.  No congestive heart failure or

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  84-year-old man diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe   
     without prior therapy.  Please evaluate for staging.
     
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation 
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 107 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the inferior orbits to the upper thighs.
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake. 
     
     INTERPRETATION:  There is intense abnormal FDG avidity within the right lower
     lobe lung mass.  An SUV could not be calculated because an accurate patient
     weight was not available.  There is also some FDG avidity above background
     within a subcarinal lymph node.  No other FDG-avid mediastinal lymph nodes are
     identified.  There is mild FDG avidity in the soft tissue at the sternal 
     dehiscence. There is mild FDG avidity within the left facet joint/pedicle of the
     mid cervical vertebral body, most likely degenerative in nature.  There is also
     mild FDG avidity within the left iliac bone just lateral to the sacroiliac
     joint.  No definite CT correlate is identified for this.
     
     Physiologic uptake is seen within the myocardium, the liver and the GI tract.
     
     Noncontrast CT images demonstrate a 5.8x5.0 cavitating right lower lobe lung
     mass.  No other definite pulmonary lesions are seen.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.  There is sternal dehiscence
     with soft tissue density filling the defect consistent with the patient's
     history of sternal debridement and muscle flap reconstruction. Within the
     abdomen, the solid organs are unremarkable.  There are a few calcified
     mesenteric lymph nodes.  There are coarse calcifications in the prostate.  The
     rectosigmoid junction and rectum appear to have a thickened wall on the
     noncontrast images.  This is a nonspecific finding.  On bone windows, there is
     degenerative changes of spine.  There is a bone Island in the right femoral
     neck.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1.  Intense FDG avidity within the right lower lobe cavitary mass.
     2.  Mild FDG avidity within a subcarinal lymph node above background FDG
     avidity. 3. Mild FDG avidity within the substernal soft tissue and within the
     left iliac bone.  4. Possible rectal thickening without FDG avidity.  This is
     difficult to evaluate without intravenous contrast.  Recommend clinical
     correlation.
