Service:  CSU


SERVICE:  Cardiothoracic Surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 40-year-old male with
2-3 month history of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. He
had a positive stress test and underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed three-vessel coronary artery
disease with an ejection fraction of approximately 35
percent. He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of
coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, status post
cadaveric renal transplant, hypertension, high cholesterol,
hepatitis C.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for smoking and positive alcohol
abuse.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

13.      Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q d.
14.      Lantus insulin.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile with stable vital
signs. His lungs were clear. Heart was regular. Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with bowel sounds present. He
had a well healed renal transplant scar.

LABORATORY DATA:  His labs are all within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen in consultation and it
was decided that the patient would undergo a coronary artery
bypass graft. The patient was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2609-4-12**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times three.
Please see the Operative Report for further details. The
patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit
postoperatively and was slowly weaned from his ventilator and
extubated. He was put on multiple agents to enhance his blood
pressure. These were slowly weaned over the next couple of
days. The Transplant Renal service was consulted for
management of his renal transplant medications and they
followed him throughout his hospital course. The patient was
weaned from the ventilator and weaned from his cardiac
medications over the next couple of days. He had chest tubes
placed intraoperatively and those were ultimately removed
prior to discharge.

Also, the [**Hospital6 7466**] was consulted for
management of his insulin during this hospital stay. They
followed him throughout and managed his insulin accordingly.
The patient continued to do well. His blood pressure
medications were slowly titrated up as he was able to be
weaned from his pressors. His chest tubes were removed.

Psychiatry was consulted on [**2609-4-14**] because the patient
was combative and there was a question of whether or not he
was withdrawing. They felt that this patient was delirious
likely due to postoperative and postanesthesia effects, as
well as nicotine and questionable alcohol withdrawal. His
delirium slowly resolved and the patient was normal without
any signs of agitation prior to discharge. The patient
continued to do well and Physical Therapy was consulted. He
was ambulating significantly on his own and continued to
improve. He was able to do stairs and actually ultimately was
going outside on his own to smoke and was active. The patient
was discharged to home on [**2609-4-17**] and he was doing well.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition on
[**2609-4-17**].

Pt OOB until 10AM and returned to bed at pt's request. AT this time,pt
alert and oriented and coopertive. SR with no ectopy and on IV NTG to control BP. Lopressor dose increased to 50mg and tolerated well.
As the day progressed pt became very demanding and restless regarding needing to go outside for a cigarette. Explanation provided but pt adamant he would go outside despite MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in room for 30 minutes
explaining his condition and medical equipment would make it dangerous. Pt pulling on epi wires/arterial line. It was decided for safety to dc epi wires/arterial line/foley/cortis/chest tube. Pt tolerated the removal of latter well and was cooperative at this time.
Social worker notified and spoke to pt.
Pt found at the foot of the bed 10 minutes after epi wires were pulled
trying to get OOB. Explanation provided to pt prior to removal of epi wires of the need for bedrest and again when pt found attempting to get OOB. After trying to assist pt back to bed safely, with a closed fist pt hit RN left forearm. Returned to bed with help. Pt agitated/restless/verbally abusive at this time. Pulled peripheral IV out and MD called. IV re-established and 5 mg haldol given IV with total of 2 mg ativan IV. Pt drowsy but arousable at this time.
However, approximately one hour later pt became extremely agitated
and attempting to get OOB. (5) staff members were required to return pt to bed.Pt on all 4's in bed trying to evade restraints. MD aware of the concern for sternal incision and pt's activity.. An additional 5 mg haldol was given IV with fair effect. At this point, a psyche consult was initiated. 
Evaulation was completed. See chart for recommendations and full note.
It was felt that a security 1:1 was necessary to protect the staff due to this pt's verbal/physical abuse. This was initiated as well as 4 point soft restraints. CSM adequate to extremities. Belt lap restraint added when pt attempting to sit up in bed despite verbal explanation and IV medications.
Pt at this time now confused. Yelling out, ""MA!"" Again,verbally abusive and not responding to any verbal explanations/orientation efforts.

IV NTG remains infusing for BP control. QTC .37 after 4 doses of haldol. Dressings dry and intact. Afebrile. FSBS per SS. Making adequate urine but has not voided since foley removed. 

Plan: Maintain safety for pt and staff with security 1:1,monitor and support BP and HR,monitor FSBS with coverage SS,assess sternal incisions for stress,support/calm pt/administer haldol as needed and monitor QTC.
