Admission Date:  [**2695-4-24**]       Discharge Date:

Date of Birth:   [**2628-3-29**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **]

DISCHARGE DATE:  Pending. Awaiting rehabilitation bed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Mitral valve regurgitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old
female with a history of paroxysm atrial fibrillation who
presented to outside hospital on [**2695-4-22**] with a three day
history of severe shortness of breath on exertion. She has
been short of breath for about one year and this has been
associated with chest tightness but no pain. She underwent
diagnostic catheterization at the outside hospital. Post
catheterization she was hypotensive and lightheaded. She was
at that point transferred to the CCU where she remained
stable and ventilated. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 184**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Breast cancer status post mastectomy.
3.  Cervical carcinoma.
4.  mitral regurgitation.
5.  Hysterectomy.
6.  Cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES: None known.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg bid.
2.  Digoxin 0.25 mg q day.
3.  Lipitor.
4.  Coumadin.
5.  Tamoxifen 10 mg bid.
6.  Zestril 5 mg q day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted under the medical
team on transfer from the outside hospital. She was continued
on the Heparin drip and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2695-4-25**] and underwent
a mitral valve repair with .................... 6 mm costal
.................... drain.

Postoperatively she continued to be in atrial fibrillation
and was started on Amiodarone.  She went into rapid atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 140s. Blood pressure was
borderline and an Amiodarone infusion was started.  She was
extubated on postoperative day zero.  EP consult was called.
Recommendations followed to continue the Amiodarone and start
Diltiazem.

Over the next few days she continued to remain in atrial
fibrillation despite the Amiodarone and Diltiazem and other
medications. On postoperative day four she developed
respiratory difficulty and had to be re-intubated and also
had right chest tube placed. Her cardiac rhythm remained in
atrial fibrillation to flutter with a rate down to the 50s.
Her blood pressure was maintained with a Neo-Synephrine drip.
Temporary transvenous pacer was placed on [**2695-5-1**].  She was
extubated on [**2695-5-2**].

Meanwhile her cardiac rhythm continued in afib / a flutter at
rates from 60s to 150s. She was started on po Lopressor. Her
chest tube was discontinued on postoperative day seven. She
was started on Levofloxacin on postoperative day eight.  She
had an increased white count and was found to have E coli in
her urine for which the Levofloxacin and Vancomycin were
started.

On [**2695-5-6**] a vascular surgery consult was obtained for a
swollen left arm. She underwent an ultrasound of the left
upper extremity to rule out DVT which was ruled out.  Her
transvenous wire and sheath were discontinued on [**2695-5-6**].
She was started on IV Heparin. She was deemed stable enough
to transfer to the regular floor on [**2695-5-7**]. By this time
she had converted into sinus rhythm with a rate in the 50s.
Her pacing wires were discontinued for transfer to the floor.

On [**2695-5-9**] she went into atrial fibrillation again. She was
minimally symptomatic. EP was consulted again and she was
given an extra dose of Amiodarone. Her IV Heparin was
continued and the plan was that she needed a pacemaker only
if she was bradycardic and in sinus rhythm. Plans are now
being made for her transfer to the [**Location 6244**] where she
will be followed by her regular cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. She
will be discharged to the PCU on a Heparin drip. She has been
started on Coumadin and is being anticoagulated. Further
decisions regarding atrial fibrillation and need for a
pacemaker will be made by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg bid.
2.  Lasix 20 mg bid times one week.
3.  Colace 100 mg bid.
4.  Aspirin enteric 325 mg po q day.
5.  Captopril 25 mg tid hold for a systolic blood pressure
less than 110.
6.  KCL 20 milliequivalents bid.
7.  Amiodarone 400 mg q day.
8.  Coumadin 5 mg q day, dose to be adjusted by physician at
the reb center depending upon the INR.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 404**]E FOLLOW UP:  Follow up is with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Location 6245**]. Follow up with primary care physician in two weeks.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:    67 y/o woman in status eplipticus following mitral valve
     replacement.  Evaluate for CVA.
     
     TECHNIQUE:   Multiplanar T1, T2 FLAIR and susceptibility images through the
     brain were performed in addition to T2W imaging.
     
     COMPARISONS;  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  Within the right cerebral hemisphere distribution of the middle
     cerebral artery, there is diffusely increased abnormal T2 and FLAIR signal
     accompanied by restricted diffusion throughout this region of the diffusion
     weighted imaging.  The appearance is consistent with a large evolving CVA in
     the middle cerebral artery territory. There are also foci of increased signal
     in the right thalamus as well as along the medial aspect of the right
     occipital and temporal lobes, raising suspicion that there may be some
     additional involvement in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery.
     There are also regions of increased FLAIR and T2 signal within the
     periventricular white matter of the left cerebral hemisphere consistent with
     chronic microvascular infarcts.  There is no shift of the normally midline
     structures. There is no hydrocephalus. No mass lesions are identified. No
     extra-axial fluid collections are identified. There is no signal drop out on
     the susceptibility images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with a massive evolving CVA in the
     distribution of middle cerebral artery territory with possible involvement of
     the posterior cerebral artery territory as well.
     
     MRA:  2D and 3D time of flight images were performed of the Circle of [**Location (un) 405**].
     These images demonstrate widely patent vessels throughout with no areas of
     abnormal narrowing or aneurysmal dilatation identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Normal MRA appearance of the Circle of [**Location (un) 405**].
