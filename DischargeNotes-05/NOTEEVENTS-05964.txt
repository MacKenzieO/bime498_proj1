Admission Date:  [**3238-11-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**3238-11-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**3144-9-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a [**Age over 90 33**]-year-old
female with a history of hypertension but no known history of
coronary artery disease, who presented to the Emergency Room
complaining of crushing [**11-10**] substernal chest pain since [**47**]
P.M. on the evening prior to admission.  This was accompanied
by shortness of breath.  In the Emergency Room, the patient
was noted to be hypotensive to the 80s/50s, and hypoxic to
86%, with a chest x-ray consistent with pulmonary edema.  The
patient was intubated and started on a dopamine drip.
Electrocardiogram revealed a new left bundle branch block.
She had a CK of 581, with an MB of 98 (index of 16.1), and a
troponin-I of greater than 50.  The patient was transferred
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where the
intervention was cancelled after extensive discussions with
the family.  The patient was then transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for conservative management of congestive heart
failure in the setting of an acute  myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with her daughter.  The
power of attorney is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname 547**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7516**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Maxzide.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Blood pressure 100/53, with a heart
rate of 71, breathing at 13.  The patient was intubated on
assist control with an FIO2 of 70, a respiratory rate of 12,
tidal volume of 500, and PEEP of 5/5.  Oxygen saturation was
99%.  In general, she appeared to be a frail, elderly female.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:  The pupils
were small but reactive bilaterally.  The patient was
intubated.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate and
rhythm, tachycardic, II/VI systolic ejection murmur over the
apex. Respiratory:  Coarse breath sounds and bibasilar
crackles.  Abdomen:  Mildly distended, with sparse bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, no rebound, no guarding.
Extremities:  The feet were cool and without palpable pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 12.9, a hematocrit of 36.6, platelets of 322, a PT of
14.4, INR of 1.4, PTT of 94.5.  Sodium 136, potassium 5.3,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 19, BUN 42, creatinine 1.1, glucose
313.  She had a CK of 581, with an MB of 98, troponin-I
greater than 50.  Chest x-ray revealed diffuse perihilar
haziness, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Electrocardiogram
revealed sinus tachycardia at 130, with a left bundle branch
block which is new compared with the prior electrocardiogram
of 1995.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   After an extensive discussion amongst the
family and the team, the patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit service for conservative management of acute
myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.  She was
initially maintained on a heparin drip and aspirin, and was
monitored with 24 hour telemetry.  She arrived to the floor
intubated and on a dopamine drip to sustain her blood
pressure.

By the next morning, the patient was extubated successfully,
and was weaned off the dopamine.  She diuresed briskly with
lasix, resulting in a marked improvement in her respiratory
status.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her
stay.  She had a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed
severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and free wall, an
ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation.

In light of this, our goal became to maximize her medical
regimen.  She was started on low-dose Lopressor, which was
carefully titrated.  She was continued on aspirin, and was
started on Captopril for afterload reduction.  She tolerated
her new medical regimen without any difficulties.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**11-10**].  Here
she had one episode of 3/10 substernal chest pain that did
not result in any electrocardiogram changes, and which
resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  The patient
remained pain-free throughout the duration of her hospital
stay.

Of note, the patient developed a cough and had a good sputum
sample, which had 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and
clusters.  For this, she was started on Levaquin for empiric
treatment of pneumonia.  She remained afebrile throughout her
stay, and there was no obvious opacity visible on chest
x-ray.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Congestive heart failure

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Lopressor 25 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
4.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily
5.  Levaquin 250 mg by mouth once daily
6.  Zestril 10 mg by mouth once daily
7.  Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every five
minutes x 3 as needed

The patient was advised to follow up with her primary
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], within one to two weeks.  The
patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
facility prior to returning home.
