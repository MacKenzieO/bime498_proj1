Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5612**] was admitted to the floor to receive FFP in order to 
bring his INR below 1.5 so that he could have pleuroscopy the 
following day.  During the first night of his admission, he was 
in a fib on telemetry and his heart rate was initially in the 
150's.  He had not taken his evening dose of atenolol yet.  He 
was given that dose, as well as a dose of IV lopressor.  His 
heart rate then came down to the 110's.  Later that evening, he 
required another dose of IV lopressor as well as PO metoprolol.  

*
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5613**] INR was originally 2.3.  He was initially given 2 
units of FFP which brought his INR down to 1.9.  An additional 2 
units were given; however, his INR was still too high at 1.8.  
The procedure was postponed until the following day so that the 
patient could receive more FFP in an attempt to lower his INR < 
1.5.  He was given an additional 2 units of FFP overnight, and a 
recheck of his INR was 1.8.  He was given 2 more units of FFP, 
but his INR remained at 1.8.  He was brought to the operating 
room to have a VATS by thoracic surgery despite having an 
INR=1.8.  He required the OR because it was a weekend day, and 
there were no [**Name8 (MD) 5614**] RN's to do the procedure in the 
pulmonary procedure suite.  After the procedure, the patient had 
a prolonged stay in the PACU because he was in rapid a fib and 
had new onset mild CHF (likely rate related).  He was diuresed 
and rate controlled (with diltiazem drip and PO metoprolol).  He 
was maintained on dilt drip and metoprolol on transfer to the 
floor.  Thoracic surgery recommended that they perform a 
decortication later in the week to free the patient's trapped 
lung.   
*
For the following week, the patient was continued on rate 
control with diltiazem drip and metoprolol.  His metoprolol was 
slowly titrated up while trying to keep SBP>90.  He was bolused 
gently on [**1-28**] occasions for low BP (with 250 cc NS).  Overall, 
the patient did well in the pre-op period; however, his rate was 
difficult to control while maintaining adequate BP.  His rate 
remained in the range of 90-110 (occasionally up to 120), with 
BP in range of 90-110/50-80.  His INR continued to rise despite 
receiving FFP and holding coumadin.  After reaching 3.2, vitamin 
K 5mg po was given x 1 dose to reverse pt so he would be able to 
go for decortication.  After vitamin K, the patient's INR fell 
to 1.9.*
Cardiology was consulted the day prior to surgery for 
recommendations of better rate control.  They recommended 
digoxin 0.125 mg PO qd and lisinopril 75mg PO TID for rate 
control. The patient was rate controlled prior to left 
thorocatomy and decortication on [**7-23**]. Post-operatively the 
patient did well and was transferred to the ICU intubated. The 
patient's TSH was evaluated and deemed to be low POD #1 with 
this may have been adding to difficult with rate control of his 
afib. His anti- hyperthroid med methimazole 10 mg PO BOD was 
restarted POD 5.The patient was diuresed with lasix while in the 
unit and responded well and his creatinine remained stable. He 
was treated with aggressive pulmonary toilet and his chest tubes 
remained to suction. POD 3 the patient had a PA and Lateral CxR 
to evaluate the left lung and the fluid in the intrapleural 
space. The patient's CXR appeared stable and much improved to 
previous films that had showed a large pleural effusion on the 
left side.The patient's pain was managed with PO morphine PRN 
and toradol 15mg PO PRN. The was put on aspiration precaustions 
and his INR was stable at 2.5. The patient began to work with PT 
on POD 3 in order to improve his mobility. The patient had a 
weak cough and difficulty moving around in bed.The patient 
remained stable in the unit POD [**3-31**]. He was transfered to the 
floor on POD 6 where he was restarted on all his home meds. 
Particularly he was switched from lopressor to atenolol and 
restarted on his glyburide 1.5 mg PO BID and coumadin 2 mg PO 
qd. The patient continued to work with PT and made improvement 
in his strength and previously limited mobility. The patient 
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in addtion to a prior schedule 
pulmonology appointment. THe patient is going to rehab on all 
his prior meds and on the same doses of those medications. He is 
doing well and will require once a day dressing changes along 
with physical therapy in order to increase his strength and 
mobility. The patient will also require aggressive pulmonary 
toilet and encourage for taking food.

     DAY.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post left thoracoscopy for pleural effusion.
     
     A previously noted large left pleural effusion has been evacuated with only a
     small amount of residual pleural fluid remaining.  There is a large
     pneumothorax in the area where the pleural fluid was evacuated.  It
     corresponds to the location of the pleural fluid prior to evacuation, and does
     not extend to the apex of the lung. This likely reflects the presence of
     pleural adhesions.  Atelectatic changes are noted in the left lower lobe and
     part of the lingula. The right lung is grossly clear but there is a persistent
     small right pleural effusion.
     
     Note is made of interval intubation with satisfactory placement of the ET
     tube.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evacuation of large left pleural effusion with large pneumothorax
     occupying site of previous pleural fluid collection, as detailed above, with
     single chest tube in place.

     thoracoscopy and drainage and trapped left lung.
     
     This study is compared to the previous study of a day earlier and shows
     continued application of the left chest tube.  The left pneumothorax is
     smaller and appears to be subpulmonic at this time.  There is poor inspiratory
     effort.  There is bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion which shows an
     appearance of worsening.  However, this could be due to poor inspiratory
     effort.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) The left pneumothorax is smaller, however, a moderate degree
     of residual subpulmonic left pneumothorax is still present.
     2) Bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and poor inspiratory effort.

     PORTABLE CHEST, 1:30 P.M. on [**7-23**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Recurrent left pleural effusion.  Status post recent thoracoscopy
     and drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared with 7/27, the left chest tube has been repositioned
     and/or replaced and the tip of the current left chest tube is at the level of
     the left apex. There is also now a second chest tube present coursing along
     the left hemidiaphragm with its tip medially. There has been considerable
     interval decrease in the moderate sized left pleural effusion.  A small right
     pleural effusion persists.
     
     Tip of the ETT is at the level of the medial clavicles in unremarkable
     position. There is a left IJ central line in place with its tip projecting
     over the upper SVC.  No obvious pneumothorax is seen with the patient supine,
     however, there is soft tissue air tracking along the left rib cage.    The
     left lower lobe shows some patchy linear atelectasis but for the most part
     appears to have reexpanded.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Decreased left pleural effusion with partial left lower lobe
     reexpansion status post thoracoscopy.  Various tubes and catheters in
     unremarkable positions.

     INDICATION:  81 year old with recurrent left pleural effusion and status post
     left thoracotomy.  Evaluate size of effusion.
     
     FINDINGS:  An AP portable study of the chest is compared to the previous study
     of one day earlier.  The left IJ line remains in place, the tip is in the
     superior vena cava.  The left chest tube remains in place, the tip is in the
     left apical region. There is a small subpulmonic pneumothorax medially, seen
     on the left side, unchanged since the previous study.  Some improvement in the
     degree of right lower lobe atelectasis is noted.  The left lower lobe remains
     atelectatic.  There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.  Right pleural
     effusion is suspected, however.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No change in position of the left chest tube or the left IJ line.
     
     2.  Right pleural effusion is probably smaller at this time than on the
     previous study, which causes improved atelectasis of the right lower lobe.  No
     evidence of left pleural effusion.
     
     3.  Small left pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE CHEST, [**3383-7-28**]:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post drainage of pleural effusion and
     decortication procedure.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of [**3383-7-26**].
     
     Two chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax.  There has been
     interval removal of a left internal jugular vascular catheter.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.  A moderate-sized left pleural effusion is again
     demonstrated with associated circumferential smoothly marginated pleural
     opacity peripherally which may represent loculated fluid or pleural
     thickening.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities predominantly in the retrocardiac
     region are again demonstrated with very slight improved aeration at the left
     lung base.  A right pleural effusion is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence
     of pneumothorax.
