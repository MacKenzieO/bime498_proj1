2 days. USOH until two days prior to admission, began to feel 
lightheaded and weak in the morning, then had bought of melena 
in evening - thought initially due to diarrhea or something she

pain, or BRBPR. Continued having melena, and reported this to 
her PD nurse, who suggested that pt report to ED. On day of 
admission, did have anorexia and did not eat anything. Of note, 
had not had ""normal"" hemoglobin when dialysis labs were drawn on 
first day of melena.  

 
In ED, was noted to have Hct of 22, down from 31.5, was thought 
to be complaining of chest pain, but in discussion with patient 
in Mandarin, she states that she has been feeling anorexic, and 
as such has felt some mild abdominal discomfort from not eating 
for the last 24 hours. Her previous anginal equivalent in [**3048**] 
was throat discomfort similar to throat dryness. Per discussion 
w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7087**], pt's cardiologist, has not had any active angina, 
negative stress in [**3051**], and no recent interventions since [**3048**]. 
NG lavage in ED negative.  

 
Otherwise, denies F/C, preceding abd pain, chest pain, SOB, 
orthopnea, DOE, joint pain, use of NSAIDS, recent med changes, 
ulcers. Does have history of chronic dysphagia, previously 
worked up ~2001 by EGD and CScope which were negative. Denies 
palpitations or irregular heart rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
75F CAD, DM, ESRD, here w/ GI bleed.
<BR>
* GI Bleed: Transfused 4u PRBC, was hemodynamic stable, 
post-transfusion, hct was  stable in the 40s.  EGD showed likely 
barretts esophagus (bx taken), erosions in stomach body, and  a 
linear erosion on the antrum (bx taken).  Advised by GI to stay 
on PPI, repeat EGD in 1 months, advance diet.  Patient continued 
to have melena, but this was to be expected.  Hct remained 
stable and patient was d/c'd home.  Tollerating POs and 
ambulating prior to d/c.
 .
* CAD: Stable,s he has  had no recent interventions, and will 
continue baby ASA (while on PPI) and statin. Antihypertensives 
were initially held, but re-started after EGD.  BP was difficult 
to controll and monitor given her known subclavian stenosis.    
EKG in ED difficult to interpret given changes in voltage 
between EKGs in limb leads, esp in absence of symptoms.  MICU 
team did speak to patient's cardiologist who states patient has 
not had any problems in the past year.  Cardiac enzymes were 
negative.  Patient can follow up as outpatient with her 
cardiologist.  
. 
* UTI:  Patient had some dysuria with Foley Cath in place.  UA 
was obtained and she was started on a short course of 
antibiotics.  Foley was removed. 
.
* ESRD: Continued per renal consult recommendations.  Started on 
Potassium repletion that should be followed as outpatient. 
.
* DM: Lantus 13U in AM. Half dose when NPO, SSHI.  
.
 
* Communication: Son [**Name (NI) **], who is HCP: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7090**] (cell), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7091**] (home)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      76 year old woman with ESRD needing AVF
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. needs bilateral vein mapping of both forearms and upper arms to assess
      veins for future fistula. Please also assess central veins to r/o any central
      stenosis. Pt. is coming to see surgeon after the mapping, please give pt. a

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  76-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease who needs AV fistula
     placement.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Evaluation of superficial veins, brachial arteries, and subclavian
     veins was performed with B-mode, color, and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
     
     FINDINGS:  On the right side, the cephalic vein presented patent and
     compressible with diameters ranging between 0.10 and 0.39 cm.  The right
     basilic vein is patent and compressible with diameters ranging between 0.32
     and 0.41 cm.  The right brachial artery presents triphasic Doppler waveforms. 
     The bilateral subclavian veins present normal phasicity.
     
     On the left arm, the brachial artery presents monophasic waveforms.  Patient's
     daughter reported long-standing decreased blood pressure in the left arm.
     
     COMPARISON:  None available.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Patent right cephalic, basilic, and subclavian veins as well as right
     brachial artery.
     2.  Monophasic Doppler waveforms in the left brachial artery, suggestive of
     proximal stenosis; also associated with decreased blood pressure per
     daughter's report.
