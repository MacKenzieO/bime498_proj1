Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2122**] 
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, shortness of breath.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation.
 
History of Present Illness:
82 F with PMH CAD, DVT, CHF(recently hospitalized [**11-16**] for CHF 
exacerbation) presented to ED this am with chest pain and SOB 
that developed while walking to radiolgy for outpatient 
ultrasound of her liver ordered by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was seen in PCP's 
office [**11-30**] for follow up of recent CHF exacerbation and found 
to have SBP 140/70 and clear lung exam.  Today per husband pt 
was walking and complained of sudden onset, sharp chest 
tightness lasting minutes associated with SOB which resolved 
with oxygen. Per husband, she has not had any recent fevers, 
chills, cough or symptoms. Normal appetite and slept well last 
night. 
.
On arrival to ED, VS HR 82 BP 62/54 RR 20 O2 86% on 2 L nasal 
canula. Pt given 2 L IVF with minimal improvement in SBP 70s and 
shortly developed increasing respiratory distress. Per ED notes, 
she was intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress. Resident who 
intubated pt reports normal intubation without evidence of 
aspiration. Pt started on Dopamine without improvement in SBP, 
so Levophed added as well. 
.
ED concerned for PE with acute onset SOB, hypotension, and h/o 
DVT. Discussion of lytics, but pt sent for CTA which did not 
show PE. CTA showed B/L pleural effusions/ consolidations/ ? air 
bronchograms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is an 82yo F with recent admission for flash 
pulmonary edema admitted for acute onset of chest pain and 
shortness of breath requiring intubation.  The pt was found to 
have CHF likely due to transient ischemia in the setting of 
diastolic heart dysfunction.
.
#. CHF- unclear etiology.  The pt was found to go into afib with 
RVR while in the MICU, but this was likely stress induced (pt in 
NSR on admission).  Perhaps pt had brief episode of ischemia 
leading to decreased LV complaince and worsening of her 
diastolic dysfunction.  The pts  TTE on [**12-3**] was c/w with some 
diastolic dysfunction.  She ruled out for MI with 3 sets of 
negative cardiac enzymes.  The pt was diuresed while in the 
MICU.  The pt was restarted on metoprolol and verapamil to 
increase her LV filling time.  Her metoprolol was titrated up to 
37.5 mg po bid and she was discharged on Toprol XL 75 mg po qd.  
The pt was discharged on verapamil 80 mg po bid.  She will need 
an outpt stress test.  Once on the floor, the pt was satting at 
92%RA while walking.  She did not require diuresis.  The pt was 
not started on ACE-inhibitor as we will defer to her outpt 
cardiologist to start this (per OMR notes, it seems pt had been 
on ACE in the past and it was stopped for some reason).  
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The pts initial presentation 
(CP, SOB, hypoxia, hypotension) was extremely concerning for PE 
and the patient was started on heparin drip but CTA was negative 
for clot. The pt was extubated on [**12-3**].  Cxr initially thought 
to be [**3-3**] aspiration but the pts clinical status had rapid 
resolution w/ diuresis.  PNA felt to be unlikely as pt had no 
fever/cough. It is felt the pt likely had transient ischemia 
leading to hypoxia/flash pulm edema. The pt r/o for MI with 3 
sets of cardiac enzymes.  The pt was often wheezing on exam, and 
her SOB near time of discharge seemed out of proportion to her 
lung exam.  Consideration may be given to outpatient PFTs.
.
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--While the pt was in the MICU 
she had an episode of Afib with RVR (HR 120s).  Given EKG on 
admission was NSR and the A fib was noted the following day, her 
Afib was likely stress induced (from LV/LA volume overload in 
setting of stiff LV).  Per OMR notes, the pt has been followed 
for an irregular heart rhythm in the past, and there has been 
concern for anticoagulation given fall risk.  The pt remained in 
NSR for the rest of her stay, and she was not started on 
anticoagulation.  Her need for anticoagulation can be further 
evaluated on an outpt basis.
.
#. Hypotension: The pt was hypotensive on arrival even after 2L 
IVF, then requiring 2 pressors in ED. This was initially 
concerning for sepsis although afebrile and lactate 1.4. Likely 
cardiogenic, although no signs of massive PE or MI; perhaps had 
ischemia which transiently worsened baseline diastolic 
dysfunction. Pts BP was stable at discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine
.
# Drop in hematocrit: Pt had Hct drop from 43 on admission [**12-2**], 
to 32 on [**12-4**].  The pt was guaiac negative.  There was no clear 
source of bleed. The pts hct was up to 35 prior to discharge.  
It is possible the one lab value on [**12-4**] was spurious
.
#CAD:  The pt has a ? h/o CAD.  She was maintained on aspirin, 
metoprolol.  The pt was not initially on a statin, so her 
cholesterol levels were ordered for risk stratification.  She 
was found to have an LDL of 127 on [**12-3**].  The pt was started on 
low dose atorvastatin 20 mg po qd.  The pt was also not on an 
ACE inhibitor on admission, but again, we will defer to her 
outpt cardiologist to start this medication (OMR notes are 
unclear if pt was on an ACE inhibitor before and it was stopped 
for some reason).  Given the pts likely episode of transient 
ischemia inducing her flash pulmonary edema, stress test would 
be warranted in the near future.  
.  
#  Episode of Atrial Fibrillation--Unclear if CHF exacerbation 
induced atrial stretch/afib or if afib led to CHF exacerbation.  
Given EKG on admission NSR and A fib noted the following day, 
Afib likely stress induced.  Concern for anticoagulation given 
fall risk
--will discuss with outpt cardiologist re anticoagulation
.
#Dispo: The pt was discharged with home PT and a walker.  She 
may need outpt PFTs and stress test.

Nsg Admit Note 2000-0700

82 yo female admitted with resp distress.  Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2**] [**11-16**] for CHF.  This morning, pt was walking to appt at radiology for an ultrasound of her liver when she became SOB and developed CP.  On arrival to ED - BP 62/54 and O2 sat 86%.  She was given IVF for the hypotension and since she has a history of DVT's they started her on a heparin gtt until she r/o for a PE.  She was intubated without problem and her CXR showed bilat pleural effusions.

She has a PMH of hepatic cysts, CAD, CHF, MR/TR, DVT, HTN,glaucoma,hypothyroidism, SVT, breast Ca [**2666**], raynaud's, and a skull fx from a fall.

She was transferred to MICU for further evaluation and tratment.
CV - Pt is afebrile.  IVF at KVO via Left femoral triple lumen catheter.  Pt also has left and right EJ iv's which are both heplocked at this point.  HR has been NSR with no ectopy.  BP has been stable depending on level of sedation she is on.  If she becomes agitated and is given a bolus of propofol - her BP will drop to the 80's sysolic.  Plan to get cardiac echo today to evaluate cardiac status.

Resp - BS course bilat.  Suctioned q1 1.2 to 3 hours for mod amt thin creamy secretions.  Sometimes it is blood tinged but that seems to be decreasing.  Continues on CMV 50% 500x14 with PEEP 10.

GI - OGT clamped.  Abd soft -min BS.  No stools noted.

GU - Foley cath draining marginal amt cl yellow urine.  

Neuro - When lightened from the propofol - pt will nod head and answer questions appropriately.  She will follow some commands.

Social - Husband and daughter came to visit last night.  They are planning to come in this morning.  Updated on status and asked appropriate questions.  They appeared comfortable with situation.

Continue to support. Plan to get cardiac echo and reevaluate after that what the plan will be.
