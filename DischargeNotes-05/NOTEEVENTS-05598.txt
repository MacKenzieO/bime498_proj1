Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] 
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a pleasant 57 yo white male well known to this 
service, who has a rather complicated PMH, including s/p bowel 
resection for Non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma of the small bowel, 
recently treated conservatively in 3/05 for partial small bowel 
obstruction, who presented to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**3087-5-20**], with complaints 
of abdominal pain with nausea vomiting.
 
Past Medical History:
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
Congential lymphatic atresia
Seminoma s/p radiation and resection
Appendectomy, perforated
Cholecystectomy
SBO ([**3086-12-29**]) s/p resection

 
Social History:
Supportive wife, otherwise denies Tob/EtOH/IDU.

 
Family History:
Father - PVD
Mother - questionable metastatic ovarian cancer
 
Physical Exam:
General: alert, oriented, well-nourished, whincing in pain
HEENT: anicteric; no JVD LAD or thyromegaly
Chest: CTA bilaterally
CV: RRR without murmur or 3rd heart sound noted
Abd: mildly distended, soft, diffusely tender
Ext: Profound bilateral lower extremity edema, distal 
neurovascular intact
 
Brief Hospital Course:
As above, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **], with a history of partial small bowel 
obstruction and Non-Hogdkin's B cell Lymphoma of small bowel, 
s/p resection, presented to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**3087-5-20**] with complaints of 
abdominal pain with nausea and bilious vomiting.  A CT scan of 
the abdomen revealed a small bowel obstruction with a clear 
transition.  He was admitted to the surgery service.  He was 
made NPO, an NG tube was placed, he was hydrated well, and 
treated conservatively for 2 days.  It was apparent that Mr. 
[**Known patient lastname 6785**] bowel obstruction was not resolving, and on [**3087-5-23**], he 
underwent an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions to 
resolve his bowel obstruction.  He tolerated the procedure well. 
However, because of his lymphatic atresia, Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is unable 
to adequately keep fluid in his intravascular space, and he 
required aggressive hydration, much of which was simply ""third 
spaced"" into his soft tissue space.  He became incredibly 
edematous, and he remained intubated in the PACU for some time.  
He eventually was extubated, which he tolerated well.  His 
recovery, while uncomplicated, was slowed by his edema.  He 
began working with physical therapy. His diet was advanced 
slowly, and it was quite evident that his bowel obstruction was 
relieved by his operation.  He eventually ambulated easily and 
often on his own.  Before discharge, his diet was advanced to 
regular, his pain was well controlled with oral pain 
medications, and his wound appeared well healing. He was 
discharged to home in good condition on [**3087-6-2**].

     INDICATION:  History of lymphoma, prior renal infarctions, and prior small-
     bowel obstruction.  Now with nausea and vomiting.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior study from [**3087-4-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
     bases to the pubic symphysis.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered
     due to the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this study.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
     seen, with associated atelectasis, which have increased slightly in comparison
     to prior study.  Emphysematous changes, including a bleb, seen within the lung
     bases.  No pulmonary nodules are identified.  Several focal hypodensities are
     seen within the liver, which are too small to characterize, but appear
     slightly smaller than in comparison to prior study.  The spleen, adrenal
     glands, and pancreas are normal.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
     Focal areas of decreased attenuation, demonstrating lack of contrast
     enhancement, are seen within the renal parenchyma consistent with infarcts,
     and are unchanged from prior study.  No free fluid or free air is seen.  Mild
     anasarca is noted in the soft tissues.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric
     or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
     
     There is dilatation of multiple loops of ileum, which are fluid filled.  The
     largest of these measures 3.8 cm in diameter.  A focal transition point can be
     seen immediately proximal to the area of prior surgery/anastomosis in the
     right lower quadrant.  No free intraperitoneal air is seen.  There is a distal
     collapse of terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum and sigmoid colon are within
     normal limits.  The sigmoid colon appears collapsed.  The bladder is normal.
     No free fluid is seen.  The prostate and seminal vesicles are within normal
     limits.  A right-sided sacral decubitus ulcer is again seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  History of prior partial small bowel obstruction.  Assess for
     contrast passage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired following
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reconstructions were made.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT scan from [**3087-5-20**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are large bilateral pleural
     effusions, which appear slightly larger on the current study.  These are
     associated with bibasilar atelectasis.  There is a small pericardial effusion.
     Located within the periphery of the right anterior lobe of the liver is a
     focal area of decreased attenuation which is too small to characterize, but
     unchanged since the prior study.  There is no new portal venous air.  The
     spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unchanged.  There are clips in the
     gallbladder fossa from prior cholecystectomy.  Both kidneys again demonstrate
     multiple peripheral areas of decreased attenuation, consistent with renal
     infarcts, unchanged since the prior study.
     
     There has been progression of small bowel dilatation.  Previously normal
     caliber loops of jejunum in the left upper quadrant are now dilated.  Within
     the right mid to lower abdomen is a loop of ileum which demonstrates wall
     thickening.  This is seen near a surgical staple line from the patient's prior
     bowel resection, which also serves as a transition point for the mechanical
     small bowel obstruction.  No oral contrast is visualized on the current study.
     This was likely removed via the patient's existing NG tube, the tip of which
     is within the stomach.  The majority of the colon remains decompressed.  There
     is a stable amount of ascitic fluid within the abdomen. There is no evidence
     of focal perforation.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, prostate
     gland are unremarkable.  Sigmoid colon and rectum are collapsed.  There is a
     small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  No pathologically enlarged inguinal
     or pelvic nodes are seen.  There is diffuse subcutaneous edema.
     
     No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.  A likely bone island is seen in
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATIONS:  57-year-old man status post exploratory laparotomy and
     adhesiolysis, and prior ileal resection for lymphoma.  Question abscess.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3087-5-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired with IV
     and oral contrast, and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The tip of a central line is seen near
     the cavoatrial junction, but its position is not fully characterized on this
     study.  The large bilateral pleural effusions are slightly larger than on the
     prior study with a similar adjacent compressive atelectases, although the
     nondependent portions of the lung bases are clear.  As before also, there is a
     small pericardial effusion.  The liver is unremarkable, and the previously
     described hypoattenuating lesion in the liver is not well demonstrated on this
     study, possibly because of differences in technique.  The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within
     normal limits.  The kidneys are small with multiple peripheral areas of
     hypoattenuation, which are unchanged suggesting prior infarcts.  The small
     bowel has considerably decompressed since the prior study and the small bowel
     loops are not dilated.  There is passage of contrast on this study only
     through the mid small bowel.  Again seen is wall thickening of the distal
     small bowel consistent with edema, as before and there is also mesenteric
     fluid, and diffuse edema in the subcutaneous soft tissues.  There is no
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  No definite ascites is
     present.  There may be a few tiny bubbles of free intraperitoneal air, likely
     from prior recent surgery.  No abscess is identified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, prostate,
     sigmoid colon, and rectum are within normal limits, and there is no inguinal
     or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Sagittal and coronal reformats confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     Beneath the midline incision site is some fluid surrounding the bowel, but

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  57-year-old man status post exploratory laparotomy and
     adhesiolysis, and prior ileal resection for lymphoma.  Question abscess.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3087-5-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired with IV
     and oral contrast, and sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The tip of a central line is seen near
     the cavoatrial junction, but its position is not fully characterized on this
     study.  The large bilateral pleural effusions are slightly larger than on the
     prior study with a similar adjacent compressive atelectases, although the
     nondependent portions of the lung bases are clear.  As before also, there is a
     small pericardial effusion.  The liver is unremarkable, and the previously
     described hypoattenuating lesion in the liver is not well demonstrated on this
     study, possibly because of differences in technique.  The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within
     normal limits.  The kidneys are small with multiple peripheral areas of
     hypoattenuation, which are unchanged suggesting prior infarcts.  The small
     bowel has considerably decompressed since the prior study and the small bowel
     loops are not dilated.  There is passage of contrast on this study only
     through the mid small bowel.  Again seen is wall thickening of the distal
     small bowel consistent with edema, as before and there is also mesenteric
     fluid, and diffuse edema in the subcutaneous soft tissues.  There is no
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  No definite ascites is
     present.  There may be a few tiny bubbles of free intraperitoneal air, likely
     from prior recent surgery.  No abscess is identified.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, prostate,
     sigmoid colon, and rectum are within normal limits, and there is no inguinal
     or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Sagittal and coronal reformats confirm the axial
     findings.
     
     Beneath the midline incision site is some fluid surrounding the bowel, but
     this appearance is not definitely changed from prior to surgery and no
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Lymphoma restaging. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18   
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 90
     milligram/deciliter. The area imaged spanned the region from the skull base to
     the proximal femurs. 
       
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake.  
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     There is focal abnormal uptake of FDG in a left supraclavicular lymph node (SUV
     4.9) which measures 1.8 x 1.3 cm.  This is new compared with the prior study of
     [**3087-2-8**]. 
      
     The focal areas of uptake in the liver seen previously are no longer seen.  The
     two foci of uptake in the deep right pelvis also are no longer present.  The
     focal uptake in the left submandibular region (SUV 5.7) and parotid gland (SUV
     3.6) is not significantly changed. 
      
     CT demonstrates large bilateral effusions, increased in size in the interval. 
     There is diffuse anasarca.   
       
     Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, liver, myocardium, kidneys, and
     bladder. 
       
     IMPRESSION:  1.  Mixed response compared with [**3087-2-8**].  The foci of uptake in
     the liver and two pelvic lymph nodes are no longer seen.  There is new uptake
     within a left supraclavicular node.  Uptake in the left neck is not
     significantly changed.  2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions.  Anasarca.

     parenchyma and pleura in patient with large cell lymphoma and recurrent
     bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     COMPARISON:  PET/CT dated [**3087-6-27**], and CT of the torso dated [**3087-4-14**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest without
     intravenous contrast.  Additional thin section reformatted images and coronal
     reformations are provided.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  In comparison with the PET/CT
     dated [**3087-6-27**], there is interval decrease in a large right-sided pleural
     effusion and marked interval decrease in a left-sided pleural effusion.  In
     comparison with the prior CT of the torso dated [**3087-4-14**], the
     pericardial effusion has resolved.  A small left supraclavicular node is again
     seen, measuring 7 mm in short-axis diameter, unchanged from the prior
     examinations.  Additional small mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes
     appear unchanged.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified.  The
     visualized portions of the heart and great vessels appear unremarkable. 
     Numerous tiny noncalcified pulmonary nodules within the right upper, right
     lower, left upper, and left lower lobes are again seen, and appear unchanged
     in comparison with [**3087-4-14**].  There is a triangular area of ground glass
     opacity within the left lower lobe (series 4, image 30), not clearly
     identified on the previous examination.  There is interval increase in
     atelectasis within the right lower lobe adjacent to the large right pleural
     effusion.  The central airways are patent.  No new nodules are identified.
     
     Limited images of the upper abdomen, including limited images of the liver,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and upper poles of the kidneys, demonstrate surgical
     clips in the gallbladder fossa consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     lesions.  A portion of the right lateral chest wall within the upper abdomen
     and lower aspect of the thorax is excluded from the field of view.  An
     addendum will be issued to this report once reformatted images including this
     region are available.
     
     There is diffuse stranding within the soft tissues consistent with anasarca.

     INDICATION: This is a 57 year old with diffuse large B cell lymphoma found on  
     terminal ileum / bladder specimens s/p R-CHOP and XRT here for restaging. 
      
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was  37 
     milligram/deciliter. The area imaged spanned the region from the base of the
     skull to the mid-thigh.

     INDICATION:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Restaging.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**3087-4-14**].  Also, comparison is made to the CT chest of
     [**3087-7-8**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
     were obtained following the administration of oral and 150 cc of Optiray
     contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are no pathologically enlarged lymph
     nodes within the axillae or mediastinum.  Couple of tiny lymph nodes are noted
     within the axillae, that do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
     There are very large bilateral pleural effusions that have increased in size
     both from [**4-14**] and [**7-8**].  There is resultant compressive
     atelectasis of the posterior lungs.  Multiple tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules
     are again noted, unchanged in size and appearance compared to [**4-14**].  The
     nodules are scattered throughout both lungs, and are [**4-19**] in number.  There is
     a small pericardial effusion, that has slightly decreased in size compared to
     [**4-14**].  A central venous catheter is noted within the SVC.  The airways
     are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The previously described hypodensities
     within the liver are not appreciated on today's exam.  The patient is post-
     cholecystectomy.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. The
     peripheral wedge-shaped hypodensities within the kidneys bilaterally are
     unchanged from [**4-14**].  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  The
     stomach and colon are unchanged.  No free air within the abdomen.  There is
     increased subcutaneous edema of the anterior and lateral abdominal walls,
     consistent with anasarca.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, prostate,
     seminal vesicles, rectum, and sigmoid are normal.  There is increased edema of
     the walls of the small bowel loops, especially within the pelvis.  This is
     thought to be related to the patient's hypoalbuminemia and generalized
     increased anasarca.  There is no free pelvic fluid, and no pathologically
     enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  A small sclerotic focus within the right sacrum is unchanged,
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  57-year-old man with increasing shortness of breath.  Coronary
     PE.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT was used to obtain contiguous axial images from
     the thoracic inlet to the lung bases.  This was performed before and after
     administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were also
     obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large left pleural
     effusion, with associated atelectasis.  Also seen is a right pleural effusion,
     which is much smaller than the pleural effusion of the CT scan of [**3087-8-8**].  At the right lung base, there is some scarring and bronchiectasis.  The
     previously described lung nodules are not well identified in this study, and
     may be located within portions of collapsed lung.  The imaged portions of the
     abdomen, including the superior most portion of the liver, spleen, and
     stomach, are unremarkable.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CHEST:  No pulmonary embolism is identified.  The heart
     and great vessels are grossly unremarkable.  There is a tiny pericardial
     effusion.  The aorta is normal in caliber, and without evidence of hematoma or
     flap.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.  There are
     degenerative changes of the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.

     MRI OF THE NECK WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM:  The study is extremely limited

     diffuse signal hyperintensity over the anterior and lateral right neck,
     extremely limiting assessment of the right parotid gland. Note is made on the
     prior FDG- PET CT that there is a marked discrepancy in attenuation of the
     parotid glands, with the right parotid gland at that time showing diffuse
     fatty replacement. Allowing for the limitations, no focal mass is seen within

     COMPARISON:  [**3087-11-28**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Patient has undergone interval pleurectomy.
     There is a pneumothorax noted at the right lung base.  Three chest tubes can
     be seen positioned within the right hemithorax, one at the lung base and two
     at the apex.  There is associated opacity of the right lung parenchyma, some
     of which may be related to atelectasis.  There is a large left pleural
     effusion again seen, which is not significantly changed in comparison to prior
     study.  The mediastinal and osseous contours are stable in appearance.  There
     is a right IJ central venous catheter with the tip within the mid SVC.  There
     is a right subclavian central venous catheter with the tip in the right
     atrium.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There has been interval right pleurectomy and VATS procedure.  There is
     associated pneumothorax at the right lung base.  Additionally, there is
     opacity at the right lung base, which may represent surgical changes with a

     ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE FOR SUPRAPUBIC CATHETER PLACEMENT
     
     INDICATION:  Patient requires suprapubic catheter with extensive previous
     abdominal surgery.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  In the operating suite, ultrasound visualization of the bladder
     was provided to the urology service who performed percutaneous suprapubic
     catheter insertion.  The bladder appeared normal.  Continuous sonographic
     visualization was provided during catheter insertion.  Following successful
     insertion of the catheter, the balloon was inflated and the catheter was noted
     to be in good position.  Urine was returned through the suprapubic catheter.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Successful provision of ultrasound to urology service for suprapubic
     catheterization.

     EXAM ORDER:  Chest.
     
     HISTORY:  Decortication and pleurectomy, status post VATS.
     
     A portable semi-upright AP view of the chest at 1:25 p.m. is compared to
     previous exam a day ago.  The hydropneumothorax in the right lung base
     although not completely visualized appears smaller on the current exam.  The
     right apical pneumothorax remains stable.  There are post-surgical changes
     seen in right lung base due to VATS procedure.  The left pleural effusion has
     increased, associated with passive atelectasis of the left lower lung.  The
     positions of the three right chest tubes, right subclavian and IJ central
     venous catheters (the tip of the subclavian line is in the right atrium) are
     unchanged since the previous exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable right apical pneumothorax, suggestion of diminished size
     of the right basilar hydropneumothorax at the region of the recent surgery.
     
     Increased moderate to large left pleural effusion since the previous
     examination a day ago.

     FINDINGS:
     
     The ventricles are not dilated.  There is no shift of intracranial structures.
     [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is a small area of

     chest fluid collection.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso of [**3087-9-27**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained without
     contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of IV Optiray,
     contiguous axial images through the chest were obtained during opacification
     of the pulmonary artery and aorta.  Coronal, sagittal, and oblique
     reconstructions were obtained.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  There is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection.  The
     aorta is of normal caliber, were visualized.  There are no filling defects
     within the pulmonary arterial vessels to suggest a pulmonary embolus.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  A chest tube is in place at the
     right lung base.  The chest tube appears to traverse the lung parenchyma, with
     the tip oriented posteromedially.  There are at least three areas of loculated
     hydropneumothorax on the right side.  The largest fluid and air collection is
     noted at the posterolateral aspect of the base of the lungs.  The tip of the
     chest tube approaches the medial aspect of this collection.  Somewhat more
     superiorly, there are at least two other areas of fluid and air collections
     within the pleural space.  The more inferior anterior lesion measures 3.2 x
     2.3 cm, as seen on series 3, image 49, and the more superior of fluid and air
     collection measures 6.4 x 3.5 cm, near the lung apex as seen on series 3,
     image 90.  The fluid material contains tiny gas bubbles, and there is an air
     fluid level.  This suggest active infection at this locale.  There is
     atelectasis at the right lung apex, and patchy opacity within the medial
     posterior right base, with a few nodular opacities.  These measure 5 to 7 mm,
     as seen on series 3, image 52 within the medial basal segment of the right
     lung.  There is a fair amount of atelectasis dependently within the right lung
     as well.  On the left side, there is a large dependent pleural effusion. There
     is associated atelectasis versus consolidation in a rounded configuration in
     the posterior and anterior aspect of the left base.  There may be a minimal
     tiny pericardial effusion present.  The airways are patent centrally.  The
     endotracheal tube is noted near the thoracic inlet, several centimeters above
     the carina.  A nasogastric tube is in place.  No discrete pathologically
     enlarged lymph nodes are noted, there is fluid within the fat of the
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
     2.  Three discrete areas of loculated hydropneumothorax within the right lung
     as described.  The appearance of air and fluid material within these
     collections suggest infection.
     3.  Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus

     noted at the posterolateral aspect of the base of the lungs.  The tip of the
     chest tube approaches the medial aspect of this collection.  Somewhat more
     superiorly, there are at least two other areas of fluid and air collections
     within the pleural space.  The more inferior anterior lesion measures 3.2 x
     2.3 cm, as seen on series 3, image 49, and the more superior of fluid and air
     collection measures 6.4 x 3.5 cm, near the lung apex as seen on series 3,
     image 90.  The fluid material contains tiny gas bubbles, and there is an air
     fluid level.  This suggest active infection at this locale.  There is
     atelectasis at the right lung apex, and patchy opacity within the medial
     posterior right base, with a few nodular opacities.  These measure 5 to 7 mm,
     as seen on series 3, image 52 within the medial basal segment of the right
     lung.  There is a fair amount of atelectasis dependently within the right lung
     as well.  On the left side, there is a large dependent pleural effusion. There
     is associated atelectasis versus consolidation in a rounded configuration in
     the posterior and anterior aspect of the left base.  There may be a minimal
     tiny pericardial effusion present.  The airways are patent centrally.  The
     endotracheal tube is noted near the thoracic inlet, several centimeters above
     the carina.  A nasogastric tube is in place.  No discrete pathologically
     enlarged lymph nodes are noted, there is fluid within the fat of the
                                                                 (Over)

     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the NG tube tip is seen within
     the stomach.  A small amount of fluid is noted anterior to the liver. Non-
     contrast enhanced visualized portions of the liver and spleen are
     unremarkable.  Ascites fluid is also noted adjacent to the spleen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy and
     pathology in this case (grade 1).
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection.
     2.  Three discrete areas of loculated hydropneumothorax within the right lung
     as described.  The appearance of air and fluid material within these
     collections suggest infection.
     3.  Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis versus
     consolidation.  Please correlate clinically.
     4.  Nodular opacities in the medial right lung base.  This may be infectious
     in nature, but a CT followup is recommended.
     
     Findings discussed with the service caring for the patient at the time of the
     exam.

     ERECT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
     
     There is interval removal of the right chest tube and interval placement of
     the left chest tube with resolution of the left pleural effusion.  However,
     there is a new small left pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema along the
     left lateral chest wall.  The endotracheal tube, the right central venous
     line, and the nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Patchy air space
     opacities are noted in the right lower lobe with no significant change
     compared to before.  The right cardiophrenic angle is not included.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Interval drainage of the left pleural effusion with development of small
     pneumothorax. Unchanged patchy air space opacities in the right lower lobe -

     tubes are all unchanged in position.  The left IJ central venous catheter tip
     is again perpendicular to the SVC wall.
     
     The right-sided hydropneumothorax has not changed since the previous study.
     The left sided hydropneumothorax appears to have increased since the prior
     study.  Moreover, there is now increased opacification of the left lung with a
     sharp inferior border.  This increased density may be due to an underlying
     infiltrate within the left upper lobe.  Correlation with a lateral radiograph
     would be helpful. There is again seen bilateral pleural effusions, right
     greater than left.  The sideport of the nasogastric tube is at the
     gastroesophageal junction.

     AP CHEST 8:00 A.M. [**1-18**].
     
     HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, VATS, pleural biopsy, empyema, new right
     thoracic window, and possible left upper lobe pneumonia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**1-16**] and 3rd:
     
     There has been substantial clearing of the new focus of left upper lobe
     consolidation seen on [**1-17**] indicating this was atelectasis.  More
     inferiorly left perihilar opacification remains, probably residual edema.
     Similarly right lower lobe consolidation has decreased in volume, now with an
     appearance unchanged since at least [**1-13**] and probably due to
     atelectasis also.
     
     The volume of the externalized pleural space in the lower right hemithorax is
     unchanged.  Persistent basal pleural space on the left is slightly larger
     today than it was on [**1-17**] but comparable to the appearance on [**1-16**], largely air filled with some pleural thickening and perhaps a small
     volume of loculated fluid, despite the left basal pleural tube.  Right apical
     pleural tube is also unchanged in position adjacent to chronically thickened
     pleurae or an apical pleural loculation.  Heart size is normal and mediastinum
     is midline.  Tip of the right central venous line projects over the right
     atrium, and a left line tip projects over the upper SVC.  ET tube ends at the
     thoracic inlet approximately 6 cm above the carina.
     
     Nasogastric tube should be advanced at least 8 cm to move all the side ports
     into the stomach.

     COMPARISON:  Previous study earlier the same date at 11 a.m.
     
     INDICATION:  Dobbhoff tube placement and tracheostomy tube placement.
     
     A feeding tube is in place with the distal radiodense tip projecting in the
     stomach, but the proximal portion of the radiodense tip is above the GE
     junction level.  A tracheostomy tube has been placed, terminating within the
     trachea at the level of the undersurface of the clavicles.  There is no
     evidence of pneumomediastinum.  With the exception of placement of
     tracheostomy tube and feeding tube, there has otherwise been no significant
     change in the appearance of the chest compared to the prior study of earlier
     the same date.  The position of the feeding tube has been discussed by
     telephone with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2094**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2095**] on the date of study.

     INDICATION:  Status post right thoracic window and decortication.  Check
     feeding tube placement.
     
     COMPARISON:  Same date at 1756 hours.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable supine chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  The lung apices are excluded from the radiograph, as is the left
     costophrenic angle.  A Dobhoff feeding tube is again seen with tip terminating
     in the distal esophagus.  A curvilinear density overlying the upper
     mediastinum suggests that the proximal portion of the Dobhoff remains coiled
     within the upper esophagus.  Endotracheal tube, right-sided chest tube, and
     right internal jugular venous access catheter appear in unchanged position.  A
     left-sided chest tube is partially imaged.  The heart size and mediastinal
     contours appear unchanged.  Patchy opacities at the left base and left
     retrocardiac opacity as well as right peri- and infra-hilar opacity appear
     unchanged.  There is a right thoracotomy defect with several inferolateral rib
     resections and packing material as well as pneumothorax at the right lung
     base.  A left subclavian venous access catheter appears in unchanged position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Persistent malpositioning of Dobhoff feeding tube.

     FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable view of the chest.  The nasogastric tube
     makes a loop in the proximal stomach, and its tip is in the region of the
     gastroesophageal junction.  The tube needs to be repositioned and advanced
     further into the stomach.  The tracheostomy tube, venous catheters and chest
     tubes appear unchanged.  Bilateral hydropneumothoraces and bilateral pulmonary
     opacities appear unchanged.

     status post right thoracic window.  Please evaluate worsening opacities.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3088-1-23**].
     
     AP chest radiograph shows tracheostomy tube, right-sided central line, left-
     sided IJ line, and nasogastric tube in stable position. The tip of a right
     chest tube overlies the apex and a left pleural tube is looped at the base.
     
     There has been mild interval improvement of the previously described right
     middle lobe opacity, with today's study appearing similar in appearance to the
     [**1-22**] study.  Again seen is an externalized right pleural space with
     pleural thickening, unchanged from prior studies. A pleural air and fluid
     loculation persists at the left base, despite the drainage tube. There has
     been mild increase in the left perihilar opacity.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild improvement of right middle lobe opacity with interval
     increase in left perihilar opacity,  suggest redistribution of edema,
     alternatively changing bilateral pneumonia.

     FINDINGS:  Two AP views have been obtained to cover entire width of thorax in
     the semi-erect position of patient.  Available for comparison is a previous
     similar study obtained five hours earlier.  During the most recent interval, a
     right-sided chest tube has been removed.  There remains, however, a loculated
     hydrothorax on the right base appearing rather unchanged in comparison with
     the previous film.  The left-sided chest tube is in unchanged location close
     to the diaphragm and apparently drains the local hydrothorax.  No significant
     interval change has occurred.  Striking is, however, that the diffuse
     increased pulmonary parenchymal densities have regressed during the few hours
     which would favor the diagnosis of pulmonary edema now responding favorably to
     therapy.

     INDICATION:  Ileus Vs. obstruction.
     
     Examination is limited as it was obtained only in the supine position and as
     it does not include the pelvis.  There is central displacement of bowel loops
     suggesting the presence of ascites.  Within the right mid abdomen, there is a
     single dilated loop of small bowel measuring about 6 cm in diameter.  Air is
     also identified within centrally displaced nondistended loops of colon. 
     Basilar pneumothoraces are seen bilaterally in the imaged portion of the lower
     chest.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Dilated loop of small bowel in the lower right mid abdomen, incompletely
     assessed on this single projection.  Full obstruction series or CT may be
     helpful to exclude the possibility of earlier partial small-bowel obstruction.
     2.  Ascites.

     PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH FROM [**2-2**]:
     
     HISTORY:  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post right VATS, pleural biopsy, and
     decortication.  Low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis.
     
     FINDINGS:  Portable semi upright AP chest radiograph shows no significant
     radiographic change in the amount or appearance of pleural density
     bilaterally, most prominent at the right apex, bilateral basilar
     consolidation, and left basilar pneumothorax with indwelling chest tube. Chest
     tube is not visible on the right, although the right lateral-most chest is not
     included in the view of the film inferiorly.  A right-sided central venous
     catheter tip is low with the tip projected over the level of the right atrium.
     The left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter tip remains at the
     level of the distal SVC.  Tracheostomy tube appears in unchanged position. The
     patient's feeding tube tip is projected off the view of the film, but is below
     the left hemidiaphragm.  A nasogastric tube has been placed and the tip and
     side-hole both below the left hemidiaphragm, with the tip coiled back to the
     cardia of the stomach.  Note that there is pinched appearance to the patient's
     right subclavian central venous catheter near the expected location of the
     skin entrance site, which may be related to a tight suture around it.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Supporting tubes and lines as described with - note particularly
     that the tip of the feeding tube is not included in the view of the film,
     distal tip of right subclavian line is projected over right atrium and there
     is pinching off of that latter tube near expected location of the skin entry
     site, possibly related to a suture.  No significant interval change in lung
     parenchymal and pleural findings.

     decortication.  Patient also with complication of empyema and status post
     thoracic window on the right side.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous studies.
     
     The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, feeding tube, bilateral central
     venous catheters, and left-sided chest tube have not changed since the
     previous study.  There remains bilateral hydropneumothoraces, left greater
     than right.  The one on the right side is not well seen as the right CP angle
     has been cut off from the study.  There are slightly lower lung volumes when
     compared to previous study.  There remains a left retrocardiac opacity.  There
     are airspace opacities seen throughout both lungs which have not changed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No interval change.  Persistent bilateral hydropneumothoraces at the lung
     bases.  Postoperative changes are less well seen on the right side due to
     patient positioning.

     HISTORY:  Lymphoma.  Recent VATS for pleural biopsy and decortication.  New
     left IJ line.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-4**] and 22:
     
     Left lung is re-expanded minimally despite moderate size left basal
     hydropneumothorax which is slowly filling with fluid despite the left basal
     pleural tube.  Air and packing material are present in the externalized right
     lower pleural space.  Increasing opacification  projecting over the adjacent
     right lower lung could be pneumonia or loculated pleural fluid.  Mild to
     moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since [**2-5**].  The heart is normal
     size though partially obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormality, and still
     mildly shifted to the right.
     
     Tracheostomy tube marginates the left wall of the trachea and should be
     evaluated clinically to see if this is appropriate.  Bilateral central venous
     catheter tips project over the SVC. Nasogastric feeding tube is looped in the
     stomach and passes out of view.

     AP CHEST, 8:49 A.M. [**2-7**].
     
     HISTORY:  Right VATS.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
     
     Question ARDS.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest films on [**2-5**] and 23rd:
     
     Appreciably more consolidation in the perihilar region of the right lung has
     developed over the past two days while questioned consolidation at the base of
     that lung, has improved.  The variability in distribution of these findings
     suggest that it is due to asymmetric edema which would also explain the more
     intense perihilar consolidation in the left lung while the periphery of the
     left lung has cleared.  The loculated pleural space at the base of the left
     chest is now entirely fluid filled traversed by a basal chest tube.
     Nasogastric feeding tube loops in the upper stomach.  Tracheostomy tube and
     bilateral central venous catheters are in standard placements.  Air fills the
     externalized pleural space at the lateral aspect of the right lung base.

     bowel obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Abdominal radiograph.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT study dated [**3088-2-1**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Note is made of 2 tubes terminating in stomach.  There is a chest
     tube overlying the left lower thorax.  Again, note is made of bibasilar
     atelectasis.  Note is made of questionable lucency overlying the left
     costophrenic angle, which may correspond to pneumothorax seen on prior CT
     scan, however, the evaluation is limited on this abdominal radiograph.  The
     patient is status post surgery and packing in right upper lung.  Note is made
     of increased opacity of the abdomen, representing ascites.  The abdomen is
     relatively gasless.

CV: HR 135 ST at beginning of shift, pt given lopressor 2.5mg iv with decrease in HR to 115-120 and BP remained stable. HR stayed in 110-[**Street Address 616**] for remainder of shift, no ectopy noted. Tmax 101.0. Pt became hypotensive spontaneously, started on neosynephrine gtt, and eventually levophed gtt to maintain MAPs> 60. Early this am able to wean down pressors slightly after pt rec'd 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate. Generalized 4+ edema noted, pedal pulses dopplerable. A-line intact, dampened at times. Heparin gtt started at 500 units/hr at 0700 for presumable PE per the thoracic team. WBC up to 35. Calcium repleted several times overnight.
