Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1304**] 
Chief Complaint:
Gait disturbance, weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of stroke nine months ago, and 
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with one day 
history of gait disturbance.  Patient initially presented to an 
outside hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] following head CT 
which revealed a left subacute infarct with small amount of 
hemmorrhage.  Of note, at outside hospital, patient's INR was 
found to be subtherapeutic at 1.3.  

Following his first stroke in January of this year, the patient 
granddaughter's stated that he had weakness (his granddaughter 
cannot recall which side), word-finding difficulties, and 
problems with simple calculations. She stated that he used to 
balance his checkbook prior to the stroke, but cannot do that 
any longer.

Mr.[**Known patient lastname 7406**] himself stated that he had no numbness or weakness on 
the day of admission, no trouble speaking or understanding 
anyone, no problems with slurred speech, and no chest pain or 
shortness of breath. He says that his only problem was ""not 
being able to walk."" He also says that on day prior to admission 
he was in his usual state of health.

[**3154-11-6**] HEAD CT w/o CONTRAST: There are blood products of 
undetermined age in right cerebellar hemisphere which is stable 
in the interval. Minimal surrounding low attenuation changes are 
present due to encephalomalacia. No new areas of hemorrhage are 
present. Stable low attenuation changes in the periventricular 
white matter are noted. There is an old infarct in the left 
hemisphere adjacent to the left lateral ventricle and within the 
right thalamus. There is no mass effect, and no shift of 
normally midline structures. No hydrocephalus is present. The 
osseous structures are unchanged. There is a small amount of 
fluid within the right maxillary sinus.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, 
anticoagulated on coumadin, now with subacute left cerebellar 
infarct with small amount of hemorrhage in setting of 
subtherapeutic INR.

1) Cerebellar infarct:  Given the fact that patient's INR was 
1.3 at an outside hospital at the time of presentation, it was 
felt that the patient most likely had an embolic event to the 
left cerebellar hemisphere prior to presentation.  Patient's 
coumadin was held during hospitalization given the small amount 
of hemorrhage within the infarct.  However, given the likely 
embolic nature of the infarct, it was felt that patient should 
restart coumadin therapy a week following discharge to prevent 
any further thromboembolic events. His primary care physician 
will follow his INR in the outpatient setting.

2) Atrial Fibrillation: As stated above, patient's 
anticoagulation was held during hospitalization.  However, 
patient was rate controlled on metoprolol with good effect, and 
patient was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.  An 
echocardiogram was performed on the day of discharge to 
determine whether or not a mural thrombus was present within the 
left atrium.  Echocardiogram with left atrium is moderately 
dilated and elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. The 
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 50%). 
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root 
is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. 
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally 
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  

3) Diabetes mellitus:  Patient was managed with outpatient 
glyburide throughout hospitalization with regular insulin 
sliding scale for additional hyperglycemic coverage.  Patient 
was normoglycemic both at presentation as well as throughout 
hospitalization on this regimen.

4) Nutrition: Patient was started on B12, Folate, and 
multivitamin at the time of admission for concern of a 
nutritional deficit as a possible etiology of symptoms.

At the time of discharge, it was felt that patient was nearing 
his baseline functional status. Patient's daughter had made the 
decision to quit her job and care for the patient in her home. 
In addition, patient was to continue physical therapy at home.  
Patient was counseled to restart coumadin in late October and to 
followup with his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] monitoring of his 
INR.  The patient's course and follow-up plan was discussed with 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**] on the day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
1) Please call your primary care physician or return to a local 
emergency room if new neurologic symptoms arise like increased 
difficulty walking, headache, speech problems, incoordination, 
bowel/bladder incontinence, numbness, tingling, or weakness.

2) Do not restart taking your coumadin at your regular dose 
until the end of October; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**] will advise [**Doctor First Name **] as to 
when to restart coumadin and he will follow your blood tests on 
a regular basis in order to determine the best coumadin dose for 
[**Doctor First Name **]. 

3) Discontinue taking aspirin.

4)Continue taking your other medications as previously directed.

3) Follow up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**], 
for within 10-14 days of discharge for followup of your coumadin 
and INR level.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please call your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**] at 
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7408**] to schedule a follow up appointment within the next 
1-2 weeks.
 
As previously agreed upon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**] will resume patient's 
anticoagulation with Coumadin in October and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7407**] 
will be responsible for following the INR.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate for hemorrhage.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Heat CT without contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:    There is an area of increased attenuation seen in the right
     cerebellar hemisphere measuring about 1 cm x 2.4 cm. There is also an area of
     low attenuation around the hyperdense area which most likely represent
     encephalomalacia. The hyperdense area could represent old blood products
     or a small area of acute hemorrhage. Correlation with prior films recommended.
     There are areas of low attenuation around the periventricular white matter
     representing chronic ischemic changes. There is an area of low attenuation
     adjacent to the left lateral ventricle representing an old infarction.
     Hypodensity adjacent to right side of third ventricle indicates a
     thalamic infarct of undetermined age. There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus,
     shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction.
     A small amount of fluid is visualized in the right maxillary sinus.  The
     surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right cerebellar encephalomalacia with evidence of blodd
     products of undetermines age. Consider correlation with prior films if any.
     If no prior films available, consider MRI.
