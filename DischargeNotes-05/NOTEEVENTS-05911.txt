History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7413**] is a 60 year old man with a history of end stage 
renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, cocaine abuse, who 
presents with fever, chills, after a fall. The history is 
unclear, mostly obtained from sister, who is not very sure. The 
patient had been feeling ""not himself"" for a few days. He had a 
fall 2 days prior to admission (unclear if had been feeling not 
well even prior to fall and that contributed to the fall), was 
seen at the [**Hospital6 327**], sent home, went to VA 
emergency department but left because of a long wait. On the 
morning of admission, he went to the [**Location (un) 173**] Veterans 
Administration Hospital for hemodialysis, and was observed to be 
shaking, then subsequently fell out of a chair, and was sent to 
this facility for further evaluation and management of the 
possible seizure. In the emergency department, he was noted to 
be agitated and received 5 mg Haldol and 4 mg Ativan, after 
which he became unresponsive and required intubation. Several 
attempts were made for intubation to protect his airway, but 
these failed secondary to edema of the oropharynx and tongue. An 
emergent tracheostomy was performed by the surgery service.  

Significant labs and studies in the emergency department 
included a BUN of 53, Cr of 13. (He was due for dialysis on day 
of admit and had missed at least 2 HD appointments shortly 
before admission.) WBC was 12.3. His head CT showed a subdural 
hematoma, and an a chest x ray revealed a developing aspiration 
pneumonia.  

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7413**] was admitted to the Neurosurgical service for 
possible evacuation of the subdural hematoma; however, because 
of its small size and ?diffuse nature, the neurosurgery team 
determined that it was not suitable for evacuation and the 
patient was transferred to the MICU. In the MICU, the patient 
was continued on empiric triple antibiotic coverage for 
meningitis and even though CSF cultures were negative because 
the lumbar puncture was performed after administration of 
antibiotics and showed increased opening pressure and white cell 
count. According to his sister, the patient's baseline 
functional status is fully active and independent in all ADLs 
and other aspects of life. He continued to be somnolent 
throughout most of his MICU stay, but opened his eyes to voice 
and was able to move all extremities and follow commands. It was 
noted that the patient's mental status seemed to improve a bit 
after dialysis, suggesting that there may also be a 
toxic-metabolic process involved in his altered mental status. 
He was also noted to have episodes of increased agitation at 
night, which were initially managed with haldol. Neurology 
suggested that the haldol may be contributing to his continued 
altered mental status, so this was changed to geodon IM as 
needed, to be used minimally. On transfer to the medicine floor, 
the patient was afebrile without leukocytosis, hemodynamically 
stable, and without respiratory distress breathing comfortably 
on tracheal face mask.

Head and Neck CT:
Cervical vertebral alignment is normal. Vertebral body height is 
maintained. 
There are no cervical fractures identified. In the sagittal 
plane, the 
prevertebral soft tissues appear full. Axial images demonstate a 
vascular 
structure extending toward the midline. This could be confirmed 
with a 
contrast-enhanced CT scan. Additionally, there is an enlarged 
thyroid gland, 
which is only partially in view on this study. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical fracture or malalignment. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M with history of cocaine abuse and ESRD, status post fall 
and suspected seizure with new subdural hematoma, altered mental 
status, and temporary dependance on tracheostomy for 
ventilation.

1. Altered mental status: Etiology remains unclear, but is 
likely multifactorial. Initially, subdural hematoma was assumed 
to be cause of altered mental status; however, it is small in 
size and has remained stable in serial imaging by CT and MRI 
scanning. Other possible contributing factors include drug or 
metabolic toxicity in the setting of ESRD, infection (meningitis 
or encephalitis), and prolonged post-ictal state. No evidence of 
cerebrovascular accident was noted on imaging.

Toxic-metabolic work-up did not reveal any abnormalities, aside 
from the elevated BUN on admission. Liver (including ammonia 
level)and thyroid function tests were normal. RPR was negative. 
Lead level was pending at time of discharge. EEG was suggestive 
of encephalopathy but no seizure activity was noted. 
Echocardiogram revealed no valvular vegetations as a possible 
source of septic emboli. He was started on thiamine, folate, and 
vitamin B12 and loaded with phenytoin for the questionable 
seizure. His mental status waxed and waned and we discontinued 
the dilantin thinking that it was causing his lethargy. Per 
neurology, his seizure history is somewhat vague, so they were 
agreeable to monitoring him in the hospital off dilantin. He did 
not have any witnessed seizures in the hospital.

He completed a two week course of empiric IV ampicillin, 
ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible meningitis. A lumbar 
puncture was obtained 3 days after antibiotics were begun 
because of initial concern that he may herniate. CSF analysis 
was significant for an elevated WBC count of 23 with 80% 
neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes. Opening pressure was also 
elevated at 33mm Hg, which although may have been partially 
positional, exceeds the expected increase, and raised concerns 
for an infectious etiology. CSF cultures were negative. PCR for 
HSV was unable to be accomplished due to lack of adequate sample 
size. patient was not cooperative with further EEG or lumbar 
puncture.

Of note, throughout his hospital course, mental status seemed to 
improve after dialysis at which time the patient was often 
oriented to being in the hospital in addition to himself and was 
able to speak in full sentences, suggesting that there may also 
be a toxic-metabolic process involved. According to his sister, 
his baseline functional status is fully active and independent. 
He was somnolent but able to open eyes to command, until 
approximately [**9-3**] when he became more aware. He was also noted 
to have episodes of increased agitation at night, thought to be 
sundowning. These were initially managed with haldol and geodon. 
Standing risperdal was started and increased to 2mg in AM and 4 
mg QPM. The risperidone seemed to have the best effect. He was 
seen by the neurology service during his hospital stay and his 
mental status was normal at time of discharge with only some 
mild condusion in the morning.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient required emergent 
tracheostomy in the ED since he was unable to protect his airway 
due to altered mental status and possiby sedation. Intubation 
was unsuccessful due to airway edema. He was weaned quickly to 
trach mask with good oxygenation, but because of the continued 
edema, decannulation could not be attempted while in the MICU. 
The tracheostomy was altered for Passy-Muir valve and the 
patient was transferred to the medicine floor while breathing 
comfortably with good oxygenation on the 35% face mask. His 
course was complicated by copious oral and tracheal secretions 
that required frequent suctioning. Nebulizer therapy with 
albuterol was given. After a week, the airway edema appeared to 
be resolved externally and he tolerated a day breathing room 
with the trach capped. Subsequently, the tracheostomy apparatus 
was removed without complication by Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4456**] surgery service 
and the patient had 97-100% saturation on room air. He was on a 
prednisone taper at time of discharge of 10 mg daily to be 
weaned over the next few days post-discharge. The wound remained 
clean, dry, and intact dressed with gauze.

3. Airway Edema: It is uncertain whether airway edema 
encountered in the ED was traumatic (multiple attempted were 
made at intubation) or caused by angioedema related causes such 
as idiopathic, hereditary, or medication related. The patient 
was not given or had no indications of taking medications 
implicated in the induction of angioedema. According to his 
sister, he may have had a history of past airway edema 
associated with medication (she is uncertain which one), but no 
one else in the family has this problem. Per report, he was not 
on an ACE-inhibitor. Complement studies were sent to evaluate 
for hereditary angioedema; to date, analysis of the complement 
pathway appears to be normal. Results of functional testing of 
C1 inhibitor are pending. CT or the neck showed evidence of 
swelling limited to the airway above the tracheostomy, as well 
as a diffuse goiter that had been noted in past studies (thyroid 
function testing was normal). He was started on prednisone 60 mg 
for three days and proceeded to undergo a slow tapering. 
Successful swallowing study for soft solids and excellent oxygen 
saturation on room air provided clinical indication that the 
airway edema improved. Otolaryngology service consulted for 
airway evaluation but the patient was not cooperative with 
rhinolaryngoscopy.  The [**Last Name (un) **]/immunology service assisted with 
the analysis of allergic or hereditary causes for the airway 
edema; however, no obvious cause was found.  The patient is 
recommended to follow up in the allergy clinic for further 
evaluation as an outpatient and to avoid ACE inhibitors.

4. End Stage Renal Disease: The patient was dialyzed 3x/week 
(M/W/F). He received nephrocaps, calcium acetate, zemplar, 
ferrlecit, and epogen. Renagel was discontinued and the calcium 
acetate was discontinued after several days.  Per nursing 
report, the patient did produce urine while on the medicine 
floor. 

5. Hypertension: In the MICU, the patient's blood pressure was 
initially quite labile and especially affected by agitation. It 
was controlled with hydralazine 25mg PO(NG) Q6hr and metoprolol 
50 mg PO(NG)TID for the majority of his hospital course. Later, 
hydralazine was weaned and discontinued in preference for 
calcium channel blockade. His regimen at discharge was 
metoprolol 50 mg BID and Nifedipine CR 30 mg daily.

5. Anemia: Iron studies point to chronic disease and renal 
failure as etiologies. He was started on epogen and ferrlecit, 
which he received at each dialysis. His hematocrit remained 
stable and he required no transfusions. Stool guaciac analyses 
were negative. There was a low hematocrit of 25.8 on [**3280-9-4**] and 
repeat draw was 28. He may need transfusion at his next 
hemodialysis.

6. Nutrition: He was started on tube feeds appropriate for ESRD, 
per nutrition recommendations, in the MICU. Since he pulled out 
his NG tube after transfer to the medicine floor, a swallowing 
evaluation showed that he was able to swallow soft solids and 
thin liquids without difficulty. However, sometimes the patient 
refused oral intake, including medication, when agitated. 
Aspiration precautions were maintained. Renal appropriate 
vitamin and mineral supplementation was provided. At time of 
discharge he was eating well with aspiration precautions.

7. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: His highly elevated PTH level 
was likely due to ESRD because a subset of ESRD patients will 
have refractory hyperparathyroidism with levels over 3 times 
normal and may need parathyroidectomy if symptomatic. The PTH 
level in this patient was most consistent with renal 
disease-induce secondary hyperparathyroidism and he was treated 
with zemplar at dialysis.  
 
8. Goiter: Neck CT with contrast confirmed a previously 
identified thyroid mass. However, the thyroid was not well 
visualized secondary to interval tracheostomy. The diffuse 
enlargement of the thyroid gland was consistent with goiter. An 
outpatient thyroid ultrasound was recommended when the patient 
is clinically stable for further evaluation. Note that thyroid 
function laboratory testing was normal.   

9. History of Fevers: During his hospital course, the patient 
was largely afebrile without leukocytosis on empiric coverage 
for meningitis. In studies performed while the patient was in 
the MICU, there was no sign of upper extremity DVT on 
ultrasound, no cardiac thrombus, no chronic sinusitis, no 
malignancy seen in spinal fluid, and no new infiltrates on CXR. 
After NG tube placement for 10 days, the patient was noted to 
have sinus air/fluid levels on imaging as expected since [**70**]% of 
patients with extended NG placement have this finding. He was 
already covered for many common organisms with his 2 week 
antibiotic regimen and he had no signs or symptoms of sinusitis. 
Urine, blood, and sputum cultures were negative. Stool was 
negative for c. difficile. Foley catheterization was 
discontinued [**8-26**]. On the general medicine service, the 
patient remained afebrile without elevated white cell count. 

10. Right shoulder pain: He presented s/p fall and his right 
shoulder was thought to be injured during that fall. Plain films 
revealed no fracture. He was unable to comply with MRI on 
[**3280-9-4**]. He will need sedation with an MRI in the near future to 
evaluate for possible rotator cuff tear.  

11. Hitory of Hepatitis C. His viral load was 1,120,000 during 
hospitalization. His will need follow up as an outpatient 
regarding possible treatment.

12. History of Prostate cancer: We were not successful at 
obtaining outside records from [**Company 7414**] or [**Hospital1 253**]. His PSA here was 7, 
baseline unknown. Prostate was not felt on rectal exam. He will 
need to follow up with his PCP regarding this.

     INDICATION:  Subdural hematoma, status post intubation.
     
     Comparison is made to the chest x-ray obtained 5 hours prior.
     
     SUPINE AP OF THE CHEST:  There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy
     tube terminating with its tip at the thoracic inlet.  An NG tube is also
     present in the esophagus with the tip not well seen, possibly at the GE
     junction.  The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged in the short
     interval.  There has been an interval development of left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Rapid development of left lower lobe collapse/consolidation and opacity at
     the right base.  This could reflect aspiration.
     2)  Distal extent of NG tube not well seen.
     3)  Status post tracheostomy tube placement.

     INDICATION:  History of fever, evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY:  No previous studies are available for comparison.
     Cardiomegaly with left ventricular enlargement is noted.  Study is limited by
     technique and body habitus, but there appears to be mild prominence of the
     vascular with some degree of mild CHF.  The superior mediastinum appears
     slightly widened, which is likely related to prominence of the vascular
     structures in that area and an ectatic aorta. A small rounded opacity is noted
     at the right cardiophrenic angle of uncertain etiology, without evaluation
     with a lateral chest x-ray.  Osseous structures are normal.  No pleural
     effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with mild CHF.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Further
     evluation with proper PA & lateral chest x-ray can be obtained of clinically
     indicated.

     FINDINGS:
     
     Cervical vertebral alignment is normal.  Vertebral body height is maintained.
     There are no cervical fractures identified.  In the sagittal plane, the
     prevertebral soft tissues appear full.  Axial images demonstate a vascular

     contrast-enhanced CT scan.  Additionally, there is an enlarged thyroid gland,
     which is only partially in view on this study.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of cervical fracture or malalignment.
     
     Further evaluation of the thyroid is recommended, and a contrast-enhanced CT
     scan of the neck might better define this structure.  Additionally, there is a
     rounded structure in the prevertebral soft tissues, which is of uncertain
     nature and may be a vascular structure.  This, too, would be better devined
     with contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck.

T/SICU Nsg Admit Note-
Pt. is a 60 yr old blk male adm to T/SICU with a subdural hematoma(left). He has hx of ESRD, on dialysis at the VA. He arrived at the [**Hospital1 22**] from the VA. Family states he's been treated for prostate Ca in the past. Records from the VA are to be faxed tonight, for a more detailed PMH/PSH. 
Pt. arrives to the T/SICU with the following tubes and lines in place: #7 portex trach; OGT (pulled out on tranfer, replaced);rt radial art line;rt hand periph IV site; left femoral triple lumen and foley cath.
Plan this evening is to optimize pulmonary status, maintaining oxygenation, give abx as ordered, loaded with dilantin in EW, to cont. here, monitor neuro status for changes(has been arousable but mostle lethargic/asleep), renal consult(dialysis tomorrow), EEG/ Head CT in am.
Brief ROS:
Neuro- Pt. has been essentially the same all shift. He will open his eyes with activity(turns..) or with verbal command but not consistantly. He's squeezed approp. x 1 but not recently. He will attempt to turn back to back with turning along with grimaces. He responds to pinches by moving effected extremity- movements appear purposeful. Pt. is febrile. His pupils are equal and 2mm, appear to respond equally to light- although they are constricted. He's moved his extremities spont. but not to command in general. Dilantin load in EW. Coughs vigorously with suctioning.

Resp- Pt. is fully vented on IMV, 18, not breathing over the vent. FIO2 weaned to 80%, TV600 and PEEP 5. Coarse breath sounds throughout. Requires suctioning of trach occ, lrg amts of thick bloody secretions. Trach site sl less bleeding over this shift, remains bloody. Leak around trach site and occ(less so) through mouth has improved but cont. to occ occur. 

CV- Pt. has been on nipride this shift to maintain BP 160-180, per NS tm. He's had occ dips in BP, infreq. that may require turning off nipride- but only briefly. He appears to need a sml amt of nipride infusing. HR 80's - 105, sinus, no ectopy. Skin warm and dry. Periph edema evident. Periph pulses palp. 

Endo- Bld sugar not requiring coverage per FS BS.

Heme/ID- Rcv'd levaquin and ceftriaxone as ordered. Tmax is 101.6. Bld cultures obtained from art line and triple lumen. Unable to get a periph. sample. Tylenol PR.

GI- OGT placed just after arrival, draining lrg amts of bilious drg(875cc). Abd soft and distended, + BS. No BM's.

GU- Foley in place, draining sml amts of urine. U/O has drifted down over shift.

Skin- Intact over all. Neck with bldy trach site, improving. Lips and tongue swollen.

Social- Family, Zetta and sister, in to see pt. Teary over situation, Sister took pt's house keys to lock his home, she believes it was open. Zetta called this evening for update.

     INDICATION:  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  Presents with altered
     mental status and fevers.
     
     LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale doppler sonograms were performed
     of the left subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic and cephalic veins. Normal
     flow, compressibility, augmentation, and waveforms were demonstrated. No
     intraluminal thrombus was identified.  Color flow and doppler waveforms of the
     AV fistula in the antecubital fossa are unremarkable with patency
     demonstrated.

Brief Hx: Pt is a 60 y/o m with a PMH of ETOH/cocaine abuse, HTN, ESRD on HD TIW,Prostate Ca, Hep C positive. Pt was in ush until a couple of days ago began to feel unwell/sluggish and was brought in to [**Hospital **] hosp where he suffered what appeared to be a seizure and fell in parking lot. Episodes of confusion and agitation while at VA.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where a CT was positive for small hematoma. Attempt to intubate for airway protection was unsuccessful so he was emergently trached. Trach is very tenuous and pt may go to OR for a new one today. Originally a pt of c/sicu transferred to MICU A at 2030.

Neuro: Initial head CT positive for small subdural hematoma. Repeat CT was stable. EEG done today. Sedated with versed and fentanyl prn for procedures today. Intermittently follows commands. MAE  Occasionally able to make needs known by mouthing words. Episode of agitation at 0200 with dramatic increase in B/P to 250 systolic. Requiring sedation with 20mcg/kg/min of propofol. Currently on 10mcg as higher dose lowers SBP to 90's. Goal B/P is 140-180 for brain perfusion. However, on [**Name8 (MD) **] MD said lower b/p's are ok for now and will reassess at rounds. Loaded with dilantin today as well. Level pending. No sz activity noted this shift. Neuro service to perform diagnostic LP. 

Cardiac: NSR on monitor with no ectopy. B/P's somewhat labile. Will drop to low 100's systolic then bounce up to 150's with minimal stimulation. Goal SBP's 140-180. Got Nicardipine earlier today for HTN currently off. HR wnl. Echo done to assess for pericarditis done yet to be read. 

Resp: On SIMV vent 12x600/40%/5/5pp. Lung sounds rhonchorous at times. Suctioned x 3 for moderate amts of bloody sputum. Sample sent for c+s. o2 sats 100% Couldn't intubate in ER so got emergent trach. Trach is very tenuous. sutured in place. Weeps blood and sputum occasionally. May go to OR for replacement. Very strong cough.  

GI: abd obese. hypoactive bowel sounds. Had ogt but was ejected during a coughing episode prior to coming to unit. MD aware will not replace until it is decided whether or not he will go to OR. FS this am 131. 

GU: U/O low throughout shift between 0-20cc/hr. ESRD. Gets HD three times a week. Had HD yesterday 3.5L taken off. Has fistula in L forearm with + bruit. pressure dressing to stay on until next HD treatment. Usually has HD on saturdays. 

ID: Afebrile, on prophylactic [**Name6 (MD) 1620**] as MD's believe etiology of decreased MS, sz, and lethargy to be either infectious (meningitis) or metabolic and not the result of the hematoma. Awaiting diagnostic LP. WBC 8.8

     INDICATION:  Evaluate thyroid mass seen on prior CT.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3280-8-15**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the neck were

     contrast was used secondary to patient's debilitation.
     
     CT OF THE NECK BEFORE AND AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION OF IV CONTRAST:  The
     patient has undergone a tracheostomy since the prior study. The tracheostomy
     obscures visualization of the previously described thyroid abnormality. There
     is diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland including the isthmus, which
     extends to the suprasternal notch, findings suggestive of a thyroid goiter. No
     focal nodules or masses are definitively seen, and there are no areas of
     abnormal enhancement within the neck.  Nasogastric tube is present within the
     esophagus.  There is partial opacification of both maxillary, ethmoid, and
     sphenoid sinuses.  The vertebral arteries, common carotid arteries, and
     internal carotid arteries all appear patent.  Visualized lung apices are
     clear.  Surrounding osseous and soft-tissue structures are within normal
     limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Previously identified abnormality described within the thyroid is
     not well visualized secondary to interval tracheostomy.  There is diffuse
     enlargement of the thyroid gland consistent with goiter.  An ultrasound can be
     performed of the thyroid when the patient is clinically stable to further
     evaluate the thyroid.

     ULTRASOUND OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY VEINS.
     
     INDICATION:  Arm swelling.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Doppler sonography of the upper limb veins was performed.
     
     The right internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, axillary vein, brachial vein
     ,caphalic and basilic veins are clearly identified.  These show normal color
     flow patterns,normal Doppler signal on Doppler interrogation and show normal
     compressibility where appropriate.  No evidence of thrombosis is identified.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     Normal Doppler ultrasound of right upper limb.

     COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**3280-8-25**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images along with diffusion weighted
     images were performed.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Study is markedly limited by patient
     motion.  The diffusion weighted images however are of diagnostic quality and
     there is no evidence of slowed diffusion present to indicate acute infarction.
     There is evidence of susceptibility artifact consistent with a left subdural
     hemorrhage tracking along the left tentorium, which is relatively unchanged
     since the prior CT scan.  No other areas of susceptibility artifact is
     demonstrated to indicate other areas of hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus
     or shift of normally mid-line structures.  Tiny foci of T2 signal
     hyperintensity are demonstrated within the left basal ganglia and right
     periventricular white matter, consistent with prior lacunes.  Mucosal
     thickening and fluid is demonstrated within both sphenoids, both maxillary,
     and ethmoid air cells.  There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air
     cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Severely limited study secondary to patient motion. Diffusion
     weighted images are of diagnostic quality and indicate no gross acute
     infarction present.
     
     2)  Left subdural hemorrhage layering along the tentorium, not significantly
     changed in extent since the prior study.
     
     3)  Opacification of the sinuses and left mastoid air cells.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  60 y/o woman.
     
     PROCEDURE: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 654**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**]. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending was present through the entire procedure. The left arm
     was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Since no suitable
     superficial vein was seen, the ultrasound was used for localization of a
     suitable vein.  The basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After local
     anesthesia with approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was
     entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.  A 0.018 guide
     wire was advanced under fluoroscopy in the superior vena cava.  Base on the
     markers of the guide wire it was determined that a length of a 40 cm would be
     suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance in the superior vena cava.  The
     sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  The final chest x-ray was
     obtained.  The film demonstrated the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
     above the right atrium.  The line is ready for use. The statlock device was
     applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm PICC line with tip in the SVC. The
     line was ready for use.
