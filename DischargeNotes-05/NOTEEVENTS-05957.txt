Sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 25,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 124.

CK 83, troponin less than 0.01.

CHEST X-RAY:  Pleural effusions bilaterally.  No evidence of
consolidation or signs of failure.

CTA:  No evidence of aortic dissection, ascending aorta
dilated to 4.3 cm tapers to normal on the descending section,
no evidence of pulmonary emboli, no pericardial effusion,
there is a small right pleural effusion, no pneumothorax.
There is a mild intrahepatic ductal dilation and simple
kidney cysts.

EKG:  Normal systolic rhythm with a rate of 70 beats per
minute.  There are Q waves in V1 to V2 and T-wave inversions
in I and aVL.  There are no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  Patient was admitted with bibasilar rales on lung
examination with a loud diastolic murmur.  She was initially
evaluated in the Emergency Department with a CTA for a
question of pulmonary embolus.  The patient did not tolerate
the dye load and had a creatinine that bumped to 2.2 and was
acutely short of breath requiring a face mask.

Given her loud murmur; an echocardiogram was performed on
[**9-11**], which showed new deterioration of his LV
systolic function with focal hypokinesis of the basal
inferior lateral wall.  Overall LV ejection fraction was over
55%.  She had a mildly dilated ascending aorta with
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets thickened, but not stenotic.
There is a noted focal fluttering echo density on the left
ventricular side of the leaflet consistent with valve tissue
or vegetation.

The patient was given gentle hydration on her first hospital
day for her intolerance of the contrast during her CTA.  She
was noted to have an increasing short of breath, and was
requiring high amounts of oxygen.  She was placed on Lasix
and nesiritide drip.  The CCU was contacted for transfer.

On transfer to the MICU, the patient was maintained on the
nesiritide and Lasix with a urine output that gradually
increased.  The etiology of her CHF was thought to be
secondary to worsened aortic regurgitation with a possibly
small contribution from her non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction, which eventually ruled in for.

The patient was briefly maintained on the nitroglycerin drip
for mean arterial pressures over 80% while in the CCU.
During her brief stay in the CCU, the patient was eventually
switched over to Lasix IV and chlorothiazide IV and had a
good urine output.  Her sats were noted to be stable in the
90s on 4-6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, and the patient
was transferred back to the floor on [**9-14**].

Patient diuresed 2-3 liters on her first several days back on
the floor and was eventually switched over to p.o. diuretic
regimen with Lasix 20 q.a.m. and hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
The patient's urine output decreased slightly over the next
several days, but she remains stable with good oxygen
saturations and improving lung examination with a decreased
jugular venous distention.

2. MI:  The patient was admitted for a rule out MI and
eventually ruled in with a peak CK of 339 and troponin of
0.91.  The patient was maintained on aspirin and a beta
blocker throughout her hospitalization.  A cardiac
catheterization was postponed given the patient's development
of acute renal failure and CHF.  It was decided toward the
end of her hospitalization, to delay cardiac catheterization
until the patient is out of the hospital.  She remained
stable throughout her hospitalization without nausea, which
was considered to be her anginal equivalent.

3. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm until [**9-16**] when she went into a brief episode
of atrial fibrillation.  The covering team started the
patient on low dosed digoxin.  The patient was maintained on
digoxin and on beta blocker throughout the rest of her
hospitalization, and self converted the following day into
normal sinus rhythm and was noted to be in a normal rhythm
throughout the remainder of hospitalization.

4. Renal:  On admission to the hospital, the patient received
a CTA for evaluation for pulmonary embolus.  After receiving
a small amount of contrast, the patient became acutely
hypoxic and required a face mask, and it was noted that her
creatinine jumped to 2.2 from her initial creatinine of 1.0.
Patient was given IV fluids, and was noted to go into heart
failure.  Patient's renal function slowly resolved throughout
the rest of her hospitalization, and her creatinine drifted
down to 1.7.  The patient was maintained on diuretics
throughout her hospitalization, and was eventually switched
over to p.o.

The etiology of her acute renal failure was thought likely
secondary to contrast-induced ATN versus congestive heart
failure causing transient hypotension and decreased perfusion
of her kidneys.

5. ID:  The patient was noted to have Citrobacter in her
urine on hospital day #4.  She was placed on renally dosed
levofloxacin and should receive a total of seven doses of
levofloxacin.  Her blood cultures were negative throughout
her hospitalization, and the patient remained afebrile.

6. Heme:  The patient had decreasing hematocrits throughout
her hospitalization.  She was initially placed on Heparin and
Integrilin after she ruled in for a MI, but given hematuria
and melanic stools, the Heparin and Integrilin were D/C'd.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells on
transfer to the CCU for a hematocrit of 27.4.  Throughout the
rest of her hospitalization, the patient was noted to have no
further blood loss, and her hematocrit was stable around 33.

     INDICATION: 88 year old female with aortic valve replacement and history of
     myocardial infarct with cardiac perforation and stent placement. Patient with
     chest pain and hypotension.  Evaluate for aortic dissection.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT imaging of the torso from the thoracic inlet to the level of the
     iliac bifurcation performed after the intravenous administration of 150 cc of
     Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to patient debility.  Additional
     reformatted images in multiple planes were also obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no evidence of aortic dissection. There is
     focal dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta which measures 4.3 cm in
     greatest dimension. There is an aortic valve prosthesis in place. The thoracic
     aorta tapers to a normal caliber within the descending portion of the thoracic
     aorta and the abdominal aorta. There is no evidence of mediastinal hematoma or
     pulmonary embolism. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
     
     There is a small right sided pleural effusion.  There is atelectasis and/or
     scarring throughout both lungs. There is a subcentimeter noncalcified
     pulmonary nodule in the right lung base.  There is no evidence of
     pneumothorax.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation
     with no evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver is
     normal in contour and attenuation with no evidence of hepatic mass. There is a
     subcentimeter low attenuation lesion within the right lobe of the liver likely
     representative of a simple hepatic cyst. The gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen
     are within normal limits.  There are multiple simple cysts within both
     kidneys. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast promptly and symmetrically
     with no evidence of renal mass. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymph
     node pathologic enlargement. There is no abnormal dilatation or wall
     thickening within the visualized portions of large and small bowel. There are
     calcified fibroids identified within the visualized portion of this patient's
     post menopausal uterus.
     
     Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
                                                                 (Over)
