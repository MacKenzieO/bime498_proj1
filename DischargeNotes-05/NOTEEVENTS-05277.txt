CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old man with a
history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, iron-deficiency
anemia, and post polio syndrome who complains of two weeks of
intermittent chest pain of worsening intensity with no
angina.  Patient had his worst episode on day of admission
and presented.  Symptoms were midsternal chest pain lasting
about 15 minutes with radiation to both arms with dyspnea on
exertion but he denies any diaphoresis, nausea, or vomiting.
Described the symptoms as a pressure and band-like sense in
both arms.  Patient thought his symptoms were
gastrointestinal in nature, though he has got no known
history of peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux
disease, and he did not seek immediate medical attention or
attend his child's wedding.

On the day of admission he presented to his primary care
physician's office after being awakened by pain.  PCP sent
him to the [**Hospital6 807**] Emergency
Room.  ECG there showed anterior ST elevations with small Qs.
Patient was given aspirin, nitroglycerin, Heparin and
Integrilin for chest pain.  He went to the Cardiac
Catheterization Lab.  There the report was notable for
three-vessel disease with 90% proximal left anterior
descending lesion that was stented to a 2 Hepakote stents,
diffuse disease in the left circumflex, and 40% mid and 80%
distal RCA lesion.

Patient was seen and evaluated by CT Surgery but turned down.
During the procedure he was found to have low cardiac output
index with cardiac output 3.7 and index of 1.78, necessitated
input of an intra-aortic balloon pump.  Patient was also
requiring Dobutamine drip to maintain his coag output and
arrived on the Dobutamine drip at 2 mcg per kg per minute.

Upon arrival to the CCU patient reported to be chest free and
breathing comfortably.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes times 15 years.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Post polio paralysis resulting in difficulty with
ambulation requiring crutches.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardizem CD 300.
2.  Avapro 150 q.d.
3.  Metformin 2000 b.i.d.
4.  Actos 30 q. day.
5.  Aspirin, which he had been holding for several days for a
scheduled colonoscopy.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Pertinent for coronary artery disease in his
mother who had coronary artery bypass graft in her 70s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a medical device technician.  He
is the youngest of two adult children.  Does not smoke or
drink but did quit tobacco 23 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient walks with cane and scooter at
baseline. There is no bright red blood per rectum.  No
melena.  Good air entry level.  Initial vitals:  100.3
temperature, heart rate 121, blood pressure 100/60,
respirations 21, satting 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His
assisted systole was 71, augmented diastole was 95, his [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6157**] was 62, his mean IAPT was 83.  Cardiac output was 8.7,
cardiac index was 3.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam he is a well developed, well
nourished man in no current distress.  He is alert and
oriented times three.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Speech is
fluent.  Exam is notable for a supple neck.  Jugulovenous
pressure approximately 10 cm.  Pupils equal, round, reactive
to light.  Lungs are clear on exam with no wheezes or
crackles.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for normal S1, S2
noted by the IABP sounds.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.
Normal bowel sounds are noted.  No organomegaly.  The AP
groin size intact.  Extremities:  Notable for palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Rectal exam is deferred
secondary to post cath on admission.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs:  Whites were 16, hematocrit
33, platelets 39, Chem-7 unremarkable, anginal CKs were 18,
MB is 6, and troponin 0.77.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient begun on aspirin, Heparin, and
Plavix.  He was weaned off the Dopamine and then also
gradually weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump.
Patient's blood pressures remained stable without balloon
pump and without pressures, and patient was called to the
floor, at which point the patient was started on Carvedilol,
and she had 3.125 mg p.o. q. day later increased to 6.25 mg
p.o. q. day.  Patient was also initially treated with
Captopril and Zoloft at the desire of the primary care
physician who admitted the patient had some cough intolerance
of ACE inhibitors in the past.  Patient was put on an ARV.

Patient remained completely chest pain free after the
procedure.  Therefore, discharged the patient on [**3082-10-4**]
to follow up with his primary care physician next few weeks,
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one month, and for

     INDICATION:  Chest pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes.  Technique is slightly lordotic.  Also,
     there is left convexity scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine.  Accounting for
     these factors, the pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The
     mediastinum is unremarkable. There is bibasilar opacity, greater on the left
     and obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  No pneumothorax.  No definite pleural
     effusions appreciated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left and obscuring the left
     hemidiaphragm.  Infectious process must be considered.

     CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
     
     Lordotic positioning.  Borderline cardiomegaly.  A femoral approach Swan-Ganz
     catheter is present, with tip over right pulmonary artery.  An IABP is
     present, with tip along the lower edge of the aortic arch.  There are low
     inspiratory volumes.  There is upper zone redistribution, with mild diffuse
     vascular blurring, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and probable
     small left effusion.  Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, I doubt interval
     change in the parenchymal findings.  The degree of vascular blurring is likely
     accentuated by low lung volumes and semiupright positioning.
