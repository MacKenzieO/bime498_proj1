     Reason: s/p fall. Swollen, painful hand.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with trauma to r hand.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      s/p fall. Swollen, painful hand.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Status post fall with right hand pain and swelling.
     
     RIGHT HAND, THREE VIEWS:  No comparisons.  The bones are diffusely
     demineralized.  There are severe osteoarthritic changes involving the
     interphalangeal joints, with associated osteophyte formation.  No definite
     fracture is seen.  Tiny ossific density adjacent to the base of the first
     proximal phalanx, likely relates to degenerative change, rather than
     representing a tiny avulsion fracture.  There are also degenerative changes
     involving the first carpal metacarpal joint.  There is no bone destruction.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Severe osteoarthritic changes.  No definite fracture identified.

Service:

ADDENDUM:  Over the last 48 hours, the patient had a
hematocrit that was 27.7 after a baseline for 48 hours of
between 30 and 31.  She received two units of packed red
blood cells.  Her hematocrit was stable after this at 34.
She showed no clinical evidence of a hemodynamically
significant bleed and I suspect the low reading was within
the error of the laboratory.

The patient also reported some left ankle and foot pain,
being unable to weight bear.  When Physical Therapy came by
to see her, she had films of both her left ankle and left
foot, which showed no evidence of fracture.  However, both
films did demonstrate significant osteopenia.  The patient
was able to fully weight bear on a rigid sole postoperative
shoe.
