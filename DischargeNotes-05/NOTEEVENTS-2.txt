     [**Hospital3 7497**] PATIENT - ROOM 337 WEST/#H31668.
     
     INDICATION:  86-year-old female short of breath with right chest pain. Rule
     out rib fracture or pneumothorax.
     
     COMPARISON FILM:  [**3421-4-13**].
     
     A single AP view of the chest, as well as right rib films were obtained.
     Diffuse interstitial opacities are present, unchanged relative to the prior
     study and most likely representing chronic interstitial lung disease.  A right
     hilar mass-like density is again present and appears slightly larger than the
     previous study.  If there is clinical concern for malignancy, dedicated PA and
     lateral views of the chest would be helpful in further evaluation.  Calcified
     costochondral cartilages are present, but I see no discrete rib fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings most likely related to chronic interstitial lung
     disease.  Right hilar mass-like density, as described.  No acute rib fractures
     identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**3421-6-10**] with increasing dyspnea and 
decreased oxygen saturation with a worsening nonproductive 
cough. The respiratory symptoms were thought be secondary to CHF 
and COPD exacerbations with possible pneumonia. She was started 
on ceftrixone & vancomycin for consideration of nosocomia 
pneumonia and given supplemental oxygen.
On HD2 she became increasingly dyspneic and tachycardic. She was 
given Lasix and her steroid dose was increased to 40mg. Her 
rapid afib was controlled with parenteral diltiazem, and then 
with digoxin.
On HD3 a family meeting was held to discuss the prognosis and 
goals of care. It was decided to provide comfort measures and 
keep them informed of her progression. Over the course of HD 4 
the patient had increased work of breathing and falling urine 
output. Housestaff was called to the bedside on 7/0/04 when the 
patient was noted to be apneic and pulseless. She was pronounced 
dead and the family was notified.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:   CHF, COPD, Desaturation and rales.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  There are no images for comparison, but comparison was
     made to the report from [**3421-1-5**].  This current study is limited due to
     respiratory motion and low lung volumes. Note specifically that cardiac and
     mediastinal/hilar contours are not well evaluated. No definite pleural
     effusions. Diffuse demineralization. Diffuse increase in interstitial
     markings, of unknown chronicity. As mentioned previously, a dedicated PA and
     lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation.
     
     IMPRESSION: Significantly limited study. The reported right hilar mass
     described previously is not well evaluated on today's study.
     
     Diffuse increase in interstial markings, of unknown chronicity.  A repeat PA
     and lateral view without respiratory motion are recommended for better
     evaluation.

     INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON: [**3421-6-10**].
     
     CHEST AP:  Again noted are bilateral basilar interstitial and pulmonary
     infiltrates.  There is upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature.
      In the interval there is improvement of the upper zone interstitial markings,
     and the interstitial markings at the bases appear slightly more prominent.
     There is no change in the infrahilar mass on the right side.  A large hiatal
     hernia is also noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Redistribution of pulmonary edema.  An infectious process in this
     region cannot be ruled out.
     
     Allowing for technical differencess, the right infrahilar mass is unchanged in
     appearance.
