Brief Hospital Course:
1. Anemia - on admission her Hct was 20.3 so she received total 
of 3 units PRBCs with an appropriate Hct bump to around 33-35. 
She was given 2 L NS in ED. This was felt to be secondary to 
bleeding from the pre-pyloric mass. GI was consulted and felt 
that she would benefit from stent placement only if she was 
nauseated/vomiting, but that it would not control the bleeding, 
so she was tried on food and tolerated all foods well. Her PPI 
was continued twice a day. It was discussed with her family that 
a conservative/palliative approach will be pursued, with 
symptomatic control with PPI twice a day, biweekly hct checks, 
and likely no readmission if she has a massive GI bleed. This 
will be conveyed to her assisted living facility, where she is 
to return.
 
2. Cardiac ischemia: Her troponins/CK were elevated during 
admission, likely secondary to ischemia from low hematocrit. As 
pt has history of bleeding, anticoagulation with heparing was 
contraindicated anyway. A betal blocker was added to her regimen 
instead of her calcium channel blocker. She was monitored on 
telemetry without any adverse events. As she is DNR/DNI, no 
further enzymes will be drawn.

3. HTN: A beta blocker was substituted for her calcium channnel 
blocker for its cardioprotective effects. Her BP was stable.

4. s/p fall: She was noted to have had a fall at the outside 
hospital, but her head CT was negative for bleed and her mental 
statyus

5. Nausea/vomiting: She tolerated clears then solid food in the 
hospital without aspiration or vomiting. She did not need 
antiemetics.

6. Code status: DNR/DNI - This was discussed with the family and 
palliative care. Also no invasive procedures (i.e. cath, EGD for 
massive GI bleed) should be done but will consider EGD/stent as 
outpatient if gastric outlet obstruction develops. The family 
will clarify her status further, with possible CMO, as an 
outpatient, and may fill out a do not hospitalize plan.
