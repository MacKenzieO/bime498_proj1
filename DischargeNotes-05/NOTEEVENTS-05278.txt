                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Mental status changes and possible sepsis.  Rule out infiltrate.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     
     SUPINE AP CHEST:  Study is severely limited by rotation and supine
     positioning.  Heart size is normal.  Moderate hiatal hernia is seen. Pulmonary
     vascularity is normal.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm and prominent irregular
     contour of the right mediastinum could be secondary to rotation or could
     represent right middle and/or partial right lower lobe collapse.  No other
     areas of parenchymal consolidation are seen.  There are no pleural effusions.
     Osseous structures show degenerative changes of the right shoulder.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Limited study due to rotation and supine positioning shows no
     evidence of pneumonia.  However, volume loss of the right lung and unusual
     contour of the right mediastinum could represent right middle and/or lower
     lobe collapse.  Re-evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs
     is necessary.

     INDICATION: Possible seizure activity and mental status changes.
     
     Multiple axial images were obtained from base to vertex without IV contrast
     administration. The examination was partially degraded by motion artifact.
     There is no focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No midline shift, mass, mass
     effect or bleed is seen. The ventricular system is symmetrical without
     evidence for hydrocephalus. There are no extra-axial fluid collections. The
     visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology. The examination was partially
     degraded by repeated motion artifact.

Admission Date:  [**2813-1-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2813-2-11**]

Service:

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Infectious disease.  Because of pneumonia community
acquired, the patient did show some signs of aspiration so
Flagyl was added to the course of Levaquin that was started.
The patient is to have a full two week course of both Flagyl
and Levaquin.

2.  Hematology.  Given the patient's anemia, Hematology was
consulted.  The anemia is felt due to nutrition deficits
given that the folate was low on admission and the INR
elevation on admission was treated with Vitamin K.  It was
recommended that Foley be changed to intravenous and B12 to
subcutaneously administration.  Folate and B-12 checked after
supplementation were found to be normal at 6.3 and 556
respectively.  Precursors for B12, homocystine and
Methylmalonic acid were checked.  The homocystine level was
found to be normal at 6.5 and the Methylmalonic Acid was
still pending upon discharge.  The patient's hematocrit was
then stabilized around 34 to 37. The patient also had a PPB
reactive to infection and inflammation.  Blood count was
normal.  Platelet count never went over one million and would
not be concerning until it reached two million.

3.  Neurology/Psychiatry.  Once the patient could communicate
and was more alert he complained that people were ""kidnaping
him and trying to hurt him"".  Psychiatry was reconsulted
regarding these paranoid delusions.  They suggested he be on
standing dose of Haldol.

4.  FEN.  For fear of aspiration the patient went for a
swallow study that showed no risk of aspirations.  He is
encouraged to take food by mouth with assistance.  He is able
to intake 50 to 60% of his needs.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
2.  Paranoid delusions.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Anemia secondary to nutritional deficits.
5.  Reactive thrombocytosis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Haldol 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q day.
3.  Vitamin B12 1000 mcg subcutaneously/IM q day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q day.
5.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. three times a day and on [**2813-2-18**].
6.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q day.
7.  Multivitamin one tablet p.o. q day.
8.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q day.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: Tension pneumothorax, status post chest tube placement.
     
     There has been interval placement of a small-bore chest tube in the right
     hemithorax.  The previously noted pneumothorax has significantly improved in
     the interval, with only a small residual apical pneumothorax remaining.
     
     The cardiac and mediastinal contours are now midline in position.  There are
     patchy and linear areas of atelectasis in the mid and lower lung zones.
     
     Note is made of a nasogastric tube coiling within the thoracoabdominal
     junction region with the distal tip directed cephalad.  This is likely coiled
     within a hiatal hernia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Marked improvement in right pneumothorax following small-bore chest tube
     placement.  Small residual apical pneumothorax remaining.
     
     2. Nasogastric tube coiled within an apparent hiatal hernia, with distal tip
     directed cephalad.

     COMPARISON:  [**2813-1-23**] at 18:04
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:  Again noted is a right apical pneumothorax which has
     increased slightly in size.  The right sided chest tube remains in place
     however a small right pig-tail has been removed.  The tip of a left PICC line
     has been pulled back and is now located in the superior vena cava.  The tip of
     nasogastric tube is coiled in a hiatal hernia.  There is bilateral lower lobe
     opacities which could represent atelectasis however an infectious process
     cannot be excluded.  There are also small bilateral effusions.  The visualized
     bones are unremarkable except for mild degenerative changes in the shoulders.

     pneumothorax has increased in size and is now relatively large, although there
     is no overt tension.
     
     There is improved aeration in the left base, which may reflect more dependent

     PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to 2 prior films from earlier today. A new
     right chest tube has been placed, with near complete re-expansion of the right
     lung; there is still  residual pneumothorax medially. The PICC catheter tip
     presumably was partly blurred on the last study, and is now seen to extend
     caudally to the level of the inferior right atrium where it is coursing
     medially.
     
     There is improving aeration in the right lung base. There is minimal patchy
     increased density at the right base, which may reflect some atelectasis. There
     is still some streaky increased density just above the hemidiaphragm but again
     no findings to suggest free intraperitoneal air.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) New right chest tube in place with considerable re-expansion of
     the right lung; residual pneumothorax is noted medially.
     
     2) PICC catheter in inferomedial right atrium; the venous access Team has been
     notified and will pull the venous catheter back into the distal SVC.
     
     3) Patchy bibasilar infiltrates, with interval improvement in aeration of the
     left base.
     
     ADDENDUM: A very small residual pneumothorax is also noted on the right
     superolaterally.

     of 3:42 PM yesterday. Mild diffuse prominent interstitial markings suggests
     mild diffuse interstitial edema. There is a more focal area of increased
     density at the right base medially and also at the left base, the latter
     possibly reflecting a left pleural effusion.
     
     Note is also made of a small atypical crescentic air collection which is in
     close proximity to the right hemidiaphragm medially. A somewhat similar
     appearance was seen on the most recent prior film. This does not clearly
     represent free intraperitoneal air as the patient is supine on both of these
     views and may instead reflect some juxtaposed basilar subsegmental
     atelectasis, although clinical correlation is recommended.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. No change in position of NG tube and small bore right chest
     tube.
     2. Moderate sized pneumothorax, increased from the film of 3:42 PM yesterday.
     3. Findings suggesting diffuse interstitial edema and likely left pleural
     effusion.
     4. See above comments regarding a small crescentic lucency at the right lung
     base in proximity to the hemidiaphragm. Clinical correlation is recommended;
     an upright chest xray may be useful.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9842**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

     NG tube repositioning.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2813-1-23**].
     
     PORTABLE CHEST: There is still a small right apical pneumothorax which has
     increased slightly compared to prior study. There is a left PICC line with its
     tip in the superior vena cava. NG tube present with its tip in the distal
     stomach. Again noted are bilateral lower lobe opacities which are most
     consistent with atelectasis. There is also a right effusion. Right chest tube
     placed. Visualized bones are unremarkable except for degenerative changes in
     the shoulders.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Small right apical pneumothorax increased slightly in size.
     2) NG tube with its tip in the distal stomach.
     3) Bilateral lower lobe opacities which may represent atelectasis, however, an
     infectious process can't be excluded.

     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: Pneumothorax.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of 1 day earlier.
     
     The examination is technically suboptimal due to exclusion of the lung apices
     from the radiograph. For this reason, the exam is being repeated at no
     additional charge to the patient and the repeat study will be dictated
     separately.
     
     Single chest tube remains in place in the right hemithorax. The previously
     noted right apical pneumothorax is not visualized but this portion of the lung
     is not included on the radiograph. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable
     in the interval. There is persistent patchy increased opacity in the lung
     bases, unchanged in the interval, and there is persistent small right pleural
     effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: Previously noted right apical pneumothorax cannot be assessed due
     to exclusion of the lung apices from the radiograph. The radiograph is
     scheduled to be repeated at no additional charge and the repeat study will be
     dictated separately.

     HISTORY:  48 y/o male with likely mental retardation and mental status changes
     from his baseline.  Assess for structural abnormality of tissue and
     vasculature.
     
     MRI OF HEAD
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the brain were obtained
     without the administration of iv contrast.  Additional diffusion weighted
     images were also  obtained.
     
     MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  This is a significantly limited evaluation of the brain
     secondary to patient motion during the acquisition of images (note this was
     also a technical problem on the patient's recent head CT exam of [**2813-1-26**]).
     Allowing for these significant limitations, there is no gross evidence of mass
     effect or shift of midline structures.  There is no ventriculomegaly.  The
     cisterns and sulci demonstrate no discernible effacement.  There are no overt
     T1 or T2 hypo/hyperintensities.  The [**Doctor Last Name 20**]/white matter interface is well
     preserved. Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute vascular
     territorial infarcts.
     
     BRAIN MRA
     
     TECHNIQUE:  3D time of flight images of the circle of [**Location (un) 405**] and its major
     tributaries were obtained.
     
     BRAIN MRA W/O CONTRAST: Again, this is a significantly limited exam secondary
     to patient motion.  There is no gross evidence of stenoses, aneurysmal
     dilatations or areas of diminutive flow.  There is a focal area of decreased
     signal within the precavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery,
     which appears probably secondary to motion artifact on the source images.
     There is no evidence, however, of decreased  flow distal to thsi region,  on
     these images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marginal quality study due to gross patient motion,  with no
     perceptible abnormalities except for a focal area of discontinuity in the
     precavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery, as discussed above.
     Correlation with the patient's clinical examination is recommended, as this
     finding may be secondary to significant patient motion during the acquisition
     of images- if there remains concern for a stenotic lesion in this locale, a
     CT angiogram may be a useful correlative study, if there is no
     contraindication to iodinated contrast infusion.

     HISTORY: 48 year old man with right lung collapse, status post chest tube
     placement and elevated white blood count.
     
     AP SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST: [**2813-2-2**] at noon.
     
     Since prior exam dated [**2813-1-27**], the right chest tube has been pulled. No
     pneumothorax is seen. Patchy density in the right mid lung probably represents
     atelectasis. The patient is rotated. Density behind the heart to the right
     side of the vertebral column is once again noted. It is unclear whether this
     represents atelectasis or a mass behind the heart.

     MRI OF THE BRAIN.
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with improving encephalopathy, nystagmus and
     possible ischemic changes for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and diffusion
     axial images of the brain were obtained.  The patient was unable to hold still
     and several of the sequences are limited by motion.  Comparison was made with
     the previous study of [**2813-1-30**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The diffusion-weighted images demonstrate no evidence of an area of
     restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarct.  No evidence of mass effect,
     midline shift or hydrocephalus is seen.  No focal areas to indicate chronic or
     acute hemorrhage are identified on the susceptibility images.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infarct or change compared to the previous
     study.

     No definite fracture.  There  are degenerative changes with narrowing of the
     right hip joint, subchondral sclerosis and spurring on the acetabular rim and
     femoral head. No evidence for avascular necrosis.Because of these changes and
     slight rotation, it is difficult to unequivocally rule out an impacted
     subcapital fracture and if there is high clinical suspicion, evaluation with
     MR exam may be helpful. Introducer sheath overlies the groin.

     COMPARISON: Portable AP chest radiograph of [**2813-2-22**].
     
     AP PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size is within normal limits. The
     patient is slightly rotated to the right. There is widening of the middle
     mediastinum, at the suprahilar level, that was present on the previous chest
     radiograph, but not present on a prior study of [**2813-2-2**]. It is unlikely to be
     pleural collection, lung collapse or a mediastinal mass, however, clinical
     correlation and CT should be considered to evaluate the nature of this widened
     mediastinum. No pleural effusions are seen. The pulmonary vascularity appears
     normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of CHF. 2) Mediastinal widening as described above.
     Clinical correlation and CT should be considered to evaluate its nature.

     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure attempted by Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1562**] and [**Doctor Last Name 294**]-D'Othee,
     staff radiologist present and supervising the procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient's daughter was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure and witnessed telephone consent was obtained.  The
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and abdomen sterile
     prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Prior to study a NGT was placed and
     gastric viscus suctioned.  Under fluoroscopy the stomach was insufflated and
     fluoroscopy demonstrated the stomach to be between the 10th and 12th ribs with
     colon positioned at the side of the stomach.  With examination in multiple

     rotation, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a NG
     tube, which extends below the diaphragm. However, the tip reverts back
     superiorly and is above the diaphragm. The position is not significantly
     changed from the previous exam. The lungs are clear.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please place PICC for TPN.

     INDICATION: Requires TPN.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2221**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 294**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee
     with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) **] (the staff radiologist) present and supervising.
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1078**] reviewed the case.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: The right upper arm was prepped in a sterile fashion.
     No suitable superficial veins were visible so ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle.  A
     0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
     Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 34
     cm was suitable.  The PICC was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 FR
     introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The sheath was
     removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final fluoroscopic image was obtained.
     The film demonstrates the tip to be in the lower SVC, proximal atrium.  The
     line is ready is use. A Statlock was applied and the line was Heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 34 cm long, 5 French, double lumen PICC
     with tip in the proximal right atrium. The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Encephalopathy with persistent tachycardia and shortness of
     breath.  Fevers without source.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis were obtained following the administration of oral contrast as well
     as 150 cc of Optiray due to patient debility.
     
     CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Several small lymph nodes are present within the left
     axilla and the mediastinum.  There is no right axillary lymphadenopathy. There
     is consolidation in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Adjacent to
     this, in the superior segment of the right upper lobe, there is a rounded
     focus of mass-like density which may be related to infection, but follow up to
     resolution is recommended to exclude TB or lung cancer.  In the right lower
     lobe, there is a patchy change consistent with aspiration.  The left lung is
     relatively clear. There are no pleural effusions.  There is a large hiatal
     hernia.
     
     ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and kidneys
     are within normal limits.  The pancreas is fatty infiltrated.  The spleen
     appears to have been removed and there is a small amount of residual splenic
     tissue just below the diaphragm.  There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     There is no free or loculated fluid.  The opacified loops of abdominal bowel
     are unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, distal ureters, and pelvic loops of bowel
     are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic free fluid or fluid collections.
     
     In the soft tissues just anterior to the inferior pubic ramus, there is a 2.3
     X 3.7 cm collection with active IV contrast extravasation.  Please correlate
     with any recent femoral punctures.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Aspiration pneumonia.  Irregular, somewhat more mass-like opacity in the
     superior segment of the right upper lobe which may be related to the
     aspiration pneumonia, but follow up to resolution is recommended to exclude

     INDICATION:  Encephalopathy with persistent tachycardia and shortness of
     breath.  Fevers without source.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images from the thoracic inlet to the pubic
     symphysis were obtained following the administration of oral contrast as well
     as 150 cc of Optiray due to patient debility.
     
     CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  Several small lymph nodes are present within the left
     axilla and the mediastinum.  There is no right axillary lymphadenopathy. There
     is consolidation in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Adjacent to
     this, in the superior segment of the right upper lobe, there is a rounded
     focus of mass-like density which may be related to infection, but follow up to
     resolution is recommended to exclude TB or lung cancer.  In the right lower
     lobe, there is a patchy change consistent with aspiration.  The left lung is
     relatively clear. There are no pleural effusions.  There is a large hiatal
     hernia.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Pneumonia.
     
     Comparison is made to previous chest radiograph from [**2813-2-28**].
     
     The right PICC line is present, terminating at the junction of the superior
     vena cava and right atrium.  There is an area of consolidation in the right
     upper lobe which is partially obscured by the mediastinum.  This corresponds
     to an area of consolidation as seen on recent CT torso.
     
     The lungs are otherwise clear.  Note is made of some motion artifact resulting
     in blurring of the vascularity.
     
     Retrocardiac rounded opacity is seen and corresponds to known hiatal hernia.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe consolidation.  This is a persistent finding
     going back to [**2813-2-3**].  Given its persistence over time, atypical
     infection such as TB should be considered.  Noninfectious etiology such as a
     bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma is also possible.

     to the level of the symphysis pubis.  Delayed images were taken from the
     pelvis and upper thigh area.
     
     COMPARISON:  Previous examination from [**2813-3-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     Parenchymal opacities are noticed in the right lower lobe with no significant
     change in comparison with the previous examination.  No pleural effusion is
     seen.  A big hiatal hernia is seen.  This hernia contains part of the stomach.
     
     The liver is normal.  No focal lesion is seen inside it.  The spleen is small
     with normal enhancement.  The pancreas and both adrenals are unremarkable.
     There is normal enhancement of both kidneys.  The bowel loops are
     unremarkable.  No enlarged lymph nodes are noticed.  There are no fluid
     collections inside the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST AND DELAYED IMAGES:
     
     A big abscess with necrotic tissue and wall enhancement is noticed
     posteroinferior to the anal canal.  There is a big connection between the
     abscess and the skin with evacuation of part of the necrotic tissue.  The
     measurement of this abscess is 3.3 x 2.8 cm.
     
     A fluid collection with peripheral enhancement is noticed in the superomedial
     aspect of the right thigh.  No extravasation of contrast material was noted in
     this fluid collection on the delayed images.  The measurement of this finding
     is 4 x 1.8 cm in comparison with 3.7 x 2.8 cm on the previous examination.

     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST AND DELAYED IMAGES:
     
     A big abscess with necrotic tissue and wall enhancement is noticed
     posteroinferior to the anal canal.  There is a big connection between the
     abscess and the skin with evacuation of part of the necrotic tissue.  The
     measurement of this abscess is 3.3 x 2.8 cm.
     
     A fluid collection with peripheral enhancement is noticed in the superomedial
     aspect of the right thigh.  No extravasation of contrast material was noted in
     this fluid collection on the delayed images.  The measurement of this finding
     is 4 x 1.8 cm in comparison with 3.7 x 2.8 cm on the previous examination.
     This finding is consistent with an abscess.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with encephalopathy and fever without source, with
     becoming septic.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases
     to the level of the symphysis pubis.  Delayed images were taken from the
     pelvis and upper thigh area.
     
     COMPARISON:  Previous examination from [**2813-3-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
     
     Parenchymal opacities are noticed in the right lower lobe with no significant
     change in comparison with the previous examination.  No pleural effusion is
     seen.  A big hiatal hernia is seen.  This hernia contains part of the stomach.
     
     The liver is normal.  No focal lesion is seen inside it.  The spleen is small
     with normal enhancement.  The pancreas and both adrenals are unremarkable.
     There is normal enhancement of both kidneys.  The bowel loops are
     unremarkable.  No enlarged lymph nodes are noticed.  There are no fluid
     collections inside the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST AND DELAYED IMAGES:
     
     A big abscess with necrotic tissue and wall enhancement is noticed
     posteroinferior to the anal canal.  There is a big connection between the
     abscess and the skin with evacuation of part of the necrotic tissue.  The

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient with fluid collection on the right thigh.
     
     COMPARISON:  Previous CT scan of the pelvis and groin area from [**2813-3-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helical contiguous axial images were obtained from the lower
     pelvis to the proximal part of the thigh.  No IV contrast was injected.
     
     FINDNINGS:  A small hypodense area is noted in the superior medial part of the
     thigh on the right side.
     
     Informed consent was obtained by phone from the patient's father.  The patient
     is not consentable.  Using fluoro-CT the right spot for tapping was found in
     the medial part of the superior thigh on the right side.  A total of 20
     seconds of fluoro CT was used.
     
     The skin was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and numbed with 5 cc of
     Lidocaine 1%.  Additional conscious sedation was administered by the Radiology
     nurse.
     
     CT LOCALIZATION:
     
     Using a 21-gauge needle, the right spot was localized for insertion of the
     drainage needle.
     
     CT PROCEDURE:
     
     Using the track of the 21-gauge needle, a spinal 18-gauge, 15 cm long needle
     was used and one pass was performed within the fluid collection.  0.5 cc of
     bloody material was tapped.  The fluid was sent to Bacteriology for gram stain
     and culture.
     
     No immediate complications were observed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9872**], the attending, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful tap of a fluid collection on the right thigh was performed.

     seconds of fluoro CT was used.
     
     The skin was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and numbed with 5 cc of
     Lidocaine 1%.  Additional conscious sedation was administered by the Radiology
     nurse.
     
     CT LOCALIZATION:
     
     Using a 21-gauge needle, the right spot was localized for insertion of the
     drainage needle.
     
     CT PROCEDURE:
     
     Using the track of the 21-gauge needle, a spinal 18-gauge, 15 cm long needle
     was used and one pass was performed within the fluid collection.  0.5 cc of
     bloody material was tapped.  The fluid was sent to Bacteriology for gram stain
     and culture.
     
     No immediate complications were observed. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9872**], the attending, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Successful tap of a fluid collection on the right thigh was performed.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     CLINICAL INDICATION: 49-year-old man with sacral decubitus ulcer and elevated
     white blood cell count.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     through the pubic symphysis following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray.
     COMPARISON: [**2813-3-18**].
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Once again, there is consolidation within
     the right lower lobe which does not appear to be significantly changed in the
     interval. There is no pleural effusion. The heart and great vessels appear
     grossly normal. Note is made of the large hiatal hernia.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas,
     kidneys, and adrenal glands appear grossly normal. The stomach and visualized
     loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no significant
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. No abnormal fat stranding or
     fluid collections are present within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and distal ureters
     appear grossly normal. The pelvic loops of small and large bowel are notable
     for chronic submucosal changes involving the upper rectum and distal sigmoid,
     suggestive of some sort of chronic inflammatory process. Within the distal
     rectum, there is a nonspecific soft tissue density filling the lumen. Although
     it may represent retained stool, it has been present in all of the previous
     examinations dating back to [**3-8**]. Alternatively, this may represent a
     villous adenoma. A sigmoidoscopy is recommended for further evaluation.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are present throughout
     the visualized bony structures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Persistent right lower lobe consolidation.
     2. Chronic inflammatory changes involving the distal sigmoid and upper rectum
     of uncertain etiology. Associated with this is a soft tissue structure within
     the lumen of the rectum which may represent chronic retained stool versus a
     villous adenoma. A sigmoidoscopy is recommended for further evaluation of both
     of these findings. There is no evidence of a perirectal or perianal abscess.

     INDICATION:  Persistent fever despite six days of antibiotics.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**2813-3-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is markedly rotated to the right.  Allowing for this,
     the cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  A right PICC line is seen with
     its tip in the right atrium.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is continued
     appearance of a right upper lobe opacity, and less so of a right lower lobe
     opacity.  The left lung is clear.  There are no pleural effusions.  The
     pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Note is made of right degenerative changes
     of the shoulder.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Continued opacity of the right upper lobe, and less so the right
     lower lobe, that could represent continued pneumonia.  However, follow up to
     ensure resolution after treatment is recommended to exclude the possibility of
     TB infection or neoplasm.

     FINDINGS:  There is increased patchiness in the right upper lobe somewhat
     vague but apparently changed vs. prior.  The right mid lung field also
     demonstrates a very subtle but increased density, as well.  Left lung is
     without infiltrate.  Pulmonary vascular markings are normal.  Lateral
     costophrenic sulci are sharply delineated.  Contrast was visualized in the

     IMPRESSION:
     
     Worsening air-space disease with focal opacities in the right upper lobe and
     right mid lung zone representing a change from prior.  With persistent fevers

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Recurrent fever spikes.  NGT placement.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of one day earlier.
     
     The examination is limited as the patient was unable to cooperate with
     standard radiographic positioning.  This resulted in incomplete imaging of the
     right lung.
     
     A NGT is no longer visualized.  The right PICC line remains in place
     terminating near the junction of the SVC and right atrium.  The cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are stable allowing for rightward rotation of the
     patient.  The left lung appears grossly clear.  The imaged portion of the
     right lung demonstrates some persistent patchy areas of increased opacity, but
     this is difficult to compare due to differences in positioning.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No NGT is visualized.  If one is indeed present, it may be coiled within
     the oropharynx.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
     2)  Limited assessment of the lungs due to incomplete imaging of the right
     lung.  Repeat radiograph is suggested to allow better comparison to the
     previous study.

     CHEST, AP PORTABLE, SINGLE VIEW, [**2813-4-12**]:
     
     INDICATION:  Recurrent fever and possible aspiration.  Evaluate for pulmonary
     infiltrates.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP view now obtained in reasonable straight position of the patient
     demonstrates remarkable asymmetry with smaller size of right-sided hemithorax
     than on left.  There is a suggestion of a mild mediastinal shift towards the
     right-sided smaller hemithorax which also shows a crowded pulmonary
     vascularity.  There is no conclusive evidence of any acute parenchymal
     infiltrates.  A suggested increased density in the mid portion of the right
     lung is coinciding with the apical portion of the scapula and therefore very
     questionable.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion in the right-sided
     lateral sinus and no evidence of apical pneumothorax is present.  A right-
     sided central venous line apparently introduced in the axillary vein reaches
     with its tip in the lower portion of the SVC terminating just at the expected
     entrance into the right atrium.  The left-sided hemithorax has a more normal
     appearance and there are no acute parenchymal infiltrates, vascular
     abnormalities or evidence of pleural effusion.  Remarkable is moderate
     widening of the thoracic aorta with a prominence of its contour overlying the
     medial portion of the left diaphragm.  The cause of this finding is unclear.
     
     Degenerative changes are seen in the right shoulder joint.  No other gross
     skeletal abnormalities short of the described asymmetry of the chest on AP
     view.
     
     Previous chest x-rays are not available for comparison.  The previous chest CT
     dated [**2813-3-22**] exists in our records but again the films cannot be
     assessed immediately.  The accompanying report describes the presence of a
     sizable hiatal hernia which can explain the prominence seen medially on the
     left lung base.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No conclusive evidence for acute pulmonary infiltrates or CHF on
     single AP chest examination.  Unexplained asymmetric presentation.
