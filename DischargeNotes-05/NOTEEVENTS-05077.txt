Admission Date:  [**3210-8-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**3210-8-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**3137-11-5**]     Sex:  F

Service:  GSURG-GOLD

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5777**] is a 72 -year-old
woman who is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2806**] of the UMG who was
admitted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-7**] in the early morning with a
probable gallstone pancreatitis.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5777**] underwent a
left carotid endarterectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1059**] on [**8-5**].  At
home, on [**3210-8-6**], Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5777**] experienced sudden
onset of an upper abdominal pain with limited emesis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She had nausea, vomiting, fever or
chills, and sweats.  She complains of diarrhea, but denies
any melena, hematochezia, or bright red blood per rectum.
She has not had any prior history of a right upper quadrant
pain or indigestion.  There were no relieving factors;
however, the pain was exacerbated by food ingestion.  There
were no urinary symptoms described by the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, and on [**3210-2-25**],
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent.
2.  History of Helicobacter pylori positive upper
gastrointestinal bleed.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident with right sided hemiparesis.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 pack year
smoking history.
5.  A question of chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left carotid endarterectomy.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Right ankle open reduction and internal fixation.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prevacid, lisinopril,
Albuterol, Atrovent, Flovent, aspirin, Paxil, and Diltiazem.

ALLERGIES:  She has allergies to Levaquin and penicillin
which cause a rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, her temperature was 98.1
F and she was afebrile without chills.  Her blood pressure
was 168/77, heart rate was 106, respiratory rate was 23, and
saturations were 95% on four liters.  She was alert and
oriented times three.  Her lung examination was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart examination was regular rate
and rhythm.  The abdominal examination showed a soft, obese
abdomen with positive right upper quadrant tenderness,
including a positive [**Doctor Last Name 66**] sign.  She also had percussion
tenderness.  There was a question of a palpable gallbladder
in the right upper quadrant.  The rectal examination was heme
positive with good rectal tone.  The pulses were palpable
bilaterally equally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES:  On admission, the CBC showed an
elevated white count of 20.2 with a hematocrit of 35.8 and
platelets of 33.8.  She had 71% neutrophils and a bandemia of
14%.  Sodium was 137, potassium 5.5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 19, BUN of 32, and creatinine was elevated to
1.7, with a baseline of 1.0 to 1.4.  Her glucose at the time
was 143.  Liver function tests showed an ALT of 13, AST of
29, and alkaline phosphatase of 79, and a total bilirubin of
0.5.  Amylase was elevated significantly to 571 and lipase
was 1,365.  A urinalysis showed 3 to 5 white blood cells with
moderate bacteria, and less than 1.0 epithelial cells per
high power field.

CT scan as per Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4456**] review with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] showed
moderately dilated gallbladder with a vascule over the liver,
mild diffusely intrahepatic ductal dilation, generous common
bile duct at 6.0 mm.  The pancreatic head looked questionably
enlarged with atrophy otherwise.  The ducts were normal.  The
colon was probably normal with or without focal thickening.
There was nothing to suggest cholecystitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Surgery team into the Intensive Care Unit for IV hydration,
antibiotics, and for a decision as to whether or not the
gallbladder would receive a percutaneous drain, versus an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
sphincterotomy, versus a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  In
addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1059**] and the Vascular service team will be
following the patient in house as well.

Overnight in the Unit, the patient was stable, but was
continued with tender, right upper quadrant pain.  She had
one episode of nausea.  By hospital day two, her white count
had decreased to 14 and her lipase had significantly
decreased to 28.  The liver function tests were still normal
when repeated, as per the previous day, and amylase was down
to 45 as well.  Mrs.[**Known patient lastname 5778**] urine output on postoperative
day two was approximately 30-70 cc/hr and she had two bowel
movements.  She continued to be NPO.  She was started at
Flagyl and ceftriaxone at the time because of her Levaquin
allergy, as prophylaxis and treatment for a potential
gallstone pancreatitis.

Because the patient was felt to still be somewhat unstable,
the decision to perform an interventional procedure was
delayed until postoperative day three.  On [**8-9**], an
ultrasound was performed to reevaluate the gallbladder which
showed a mildly distended gallbladder with sludge.  However,
there were no gallbladder stones or thickening, and there was
no pericholecystic fluid.  Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 5778**] vital signs
continued to be stable and her white count continued to fall
from 14.3 to 13 by hospital day four.  The panel 7 continued
to be normal and the amylase and lipase continued to be also
within normal limits at 51.  Stool was sent for Clostridium
difficile that was negative and a urinalysis was also
negative at this time.

Because of the recent carotid endarterectomy, there was much
discussion as to the appropriate management of her condition.
Because she had become stable in the Intensive Care Unit on
[**8-10**], she was transferred to the floor.  There was a
coughing spell on transfer and respiratory therapy helped.
In addition, Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5777**] was to have a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy on [**8-10**].  Her laparoscopic
cholecystectomy occurred at approximately 03:00 PM on [**8-10**] and was uneventful.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 5777**] remained on perioperative antibiotics and had a
postoperative hematocrit of 29.5.  By hospital day six, her
hematocrit had returned to 35.3 and she was recovering bowel
function, such that her diet was advanced.  Case manager had
screened her for rehabilitation and on hospital day seven,
her antibiotics were discontinued and she was advanced to a
full diet.  She will be discharged to home with a home
nursing care for taking care of her today, on [**3210-8-12**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with nursing care.

FOLLOW-UP:  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks and
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1059**] from Vascular in approximately three weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet one to two tablets po q four
to six hours prn, Colace 100 mg po bid, Serevent two puffs po
bid, Combivent two puffs po tid, Flovent two puffs po bid,
Lasix 40 mg po q day, Ativan 0.5 mg q six hours po prn

hours, Paxil 20 mg po q day, and Flomax 0.4 mg po bid.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
2.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy for treatment of
a presumed gallstone pancreatitis.

     HISTORY: 72 year old woman with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough and
     wheezing.
     
     Comparison to study from [**3210-8-3**].
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Heart size and mediastinal and hilar contours are stable
     with a calcified thoracic aorta.  There is attenuation of pulmonary
     vasculature in the upper lung zones.  The lungs are hyperinflated with
     flattening of the diaphragms.  Plate-like atelectasis is seen at both lung
     bases.  No effusions are identified. Degenerative change is again identified
     in the thoracic spine with an upper thoracic kyphosis. An NG tube is present,
     terminating in the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Bibasilar opacities most likely representing plate-like atelectasis.
     Bibasilar pneumonia is considered less likely but cannot be excluded in this
     patient with cough and elevated white count.
     
     2) Emphysema.

      72 year old woman with h/o COPD, CHF, s/p appendectomy in the past with sudden
      onset N/V, and abd pain worst in epigastric and RUQ regions, has WBC count
      20,000 and 14% bands
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o diverticulitis, abscess, cholecystitis
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Epigastric pain, vomiting, and elevated white blood cell count.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helical CT was performed from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis following administration of IV and PO contrast.  150 cc of Optiray
     were administered for indication of multiple allergies.  3D reconstructions
     were created through the abdomen and pelvis per CT enterography protocol.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is moderate atelectasis at the lung bases. The
     gallbladder is distended, though without discrete wall thickneing or
     pericholecystic fluid collections.  There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation throughout all lobes.  However, the common bile duct does not
     appear dilated at 6 mm.  The pancreas is somewhat diminutive, and without
     pancreatic ductal dilatation or calcifications.  The spleen, adrenals, and
     abdominal bowel loops are normal in appearance.  There are multiple exophytic
     cysts on both kidneys, the largest in the right lower pole measuring 4.2 cm x
     4.6 cm.  There is no ascites.  Several small mesenteric and retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes do not attain CT critera for pathologic enlargement.  There is
     moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. Incidental note is
     made of subcutaneous nodules consistent with injection sites.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Enteric contrast reaches the rectum, without evidence
     of obstruction.  The uterus and bladder are normal in appearance.  The bones
     are unremarkable.
     
     3D RECONSTRUCTIONS: Again noted are multiple renal cysts.  There is no
     evidence of bowel obstruction.  Moderate intrahepatic ductal dilatation is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Intrahepatic ductal dilatation and gallbladder distension are consistent
     with biliary obstruction.  There are no focal signs of inflammation to suggest
     a complicated infection. This may relate to a recently passed stone.
     
     2. Bilateral renal cysts.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Epigastric pain, vomiting, and elevated white blood cell count.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helical CT was performed from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis following administration of IV and PO contrast.  150 cc of Optiray
     were administered for indication of multiple allergies.  3D reconstructions
     were created through the abdomen and pelvis per CT enterography protocol.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is moderate atelectasis at the lung bases. The
     gallbladder is distended, though without discrete wall thickneing or
     pericholecystic fluid collections.  There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation throughout all lobes.  However, the common bile duct does not
     appear dilated at 6 mm.  The pancreas is somewhat diminutive, and without
     pancreatic ductal dilatation or calcifications.  The spleen, adrenals, and
     abdominal bowel loops are normal in appearance.  There are multiple exophytic
     cysts on both kidneys, the largest in the right lower pole measuring 4.2 cm x
     4.6 cm.  There is no ascites.  Several small mesenteric and retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes do not attain CT critera for pathologic enlargement.  There is
     moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. Incidental note is
     made of subcutaneous nodules consistent with injection sites.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Enteric contrast reaches the rectum, without evidence
     of obstruction.  The uterus and bladder are normal in appearance.  The bones
     are unremarkable.
     
     3D RECONSTRUCTIONS: Again noted are multiple renal cysts.  There is no
     evidence of bowel obstruction.  Moderate intrahepatic ductal dilatation is
     noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Intrahepatic ductal dilatation and gallbladder distension are consistent
     with biliary obstruction.  There are no focal signs of inflammation to suggest
     a complicated infection. This may relate to a recently passed stone.
     
     2. Bilateral renal cysts.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

     bandemia.
     
     The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  The pulmonary vascularity does not
     appear engorged.  There is relative hyperlucency in the upper lobes with
     paucity of vessels suggesting emphysema.  There is some focal apical scarring
     at the left apex.
     
     Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities appear slightly improved in the interval
     at the right base and not significantly changed at the left base.  There are
     small bilateral pleural effusions, which are new in the interval.
     
     Diffuse osteoporosis is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
     
     2. Bibasilar parenchymal opacities, slightly improved at the right base, and

     FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation demonstrates hypoechoic plaque along the right
     internal carotid artery with a peak velocity of 162 cm/sec. with end diastolic
     velocity of 38 cm/sec.  The systolic ICA/CCA ratio measures 2.0 on the right.
     Antegrade flow is seen along the right vertebral artery.  Along the left
     internal carotid artery there is no obvious plaque.  Peak velocity measures
     102 cm/sec. with end diastolic velocity of 22 cm/sec.  The systolic ICA/CCA
     ratio measures 1.0 on the left.  Antegrade flow is seen along the left
     vertebral artery.
     
     CONCLUSION:  1)  40-59% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
     2)  Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. 3)  Antegrade
     flow along both vertebral arteries.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Known bilateral carotid stenosis, recent stroke.
     
     FINDINGS: Minimal wall thickening at the origin of the left ICA, however the
     peak systolic velocities on the left are within normal limits as is the
     ICA-CCA ratio.
     
     On the right there is mild heterogeneous calcified ICA plaque.  The peak
     systolic velocities are 143, 83 and 166 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA and ECA
     respectively.  The ICA-CCA ratio is 1.7.  Findings indicate a 40-59% right ICA
     stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION: No change compared to the exam of [**8-/3210**], i.e.:
     1) 40-59% right ICA stenosis.
     
     2) No significant left ICA stenosis status post endarterectomy.
