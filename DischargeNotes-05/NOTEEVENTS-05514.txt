HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
woman who last week complained of lower back pain. She does
not have any weakness per se but she had tingling in the
posterior thigh area bilaterally.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure.

Coronary artery disease.

Hypertension.

Diabetes mellitus.

Aortic valve replacement.

Coronary artery bypass graft.

Mitral valve replacement.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Bextra.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
is afebrile, heart rate 58, blood pressure 127/43,
respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation 91% in room air. No
acute distress. Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. Chest
clear to auscultation. Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Rectal tone is normal. Neurologically, awake, alert and
oriented x3. Speech is fluent. Per the daughter, the patient
does not speak much English. Cranial nerves are intact. Her
strength - deltoids are 5- bilaterally, biceps 5-
bilaterally, triceps 5-, grasp 5-, IP, gastrocnemius, and [**Last Name (un) **]
are all 5-. Her reflexes are 1+ throughout. Her toes are
downgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a CT which demonstrates a
L1 compression deformity with 60% to 70% loss of height and
minimal retropulsion with no neural compression.

had upright films in the brace which showed stability of her
spine without further retropulsion. The patient was seen by
physical therapy and occupational therapy and found to be
safe for discharge to home with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1496**] in
4 weeks with repeat AP and lateral thoracolumbar spine films.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  L1 compression fracture.  Please evaluate.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior studies are available for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast helical scanning of the lumbar spine was
     performed without IV contrast.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is near complete loss of height of the L1 vertebral body.
     Loss of height is more pronounced anteriorly than posteriorly.  The remainder
     of the lumbar vertebral body heights are maintained.  The alignment is normal.
     There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, with anterior osteophytes
     of the L2 vertebral body.  There is retropulsion of the superior corner of the
     L1 body into the spinal canal with approximately 40% compromise of the lumen.
     There are likely fracture fragments anterior to the L1 vertebral body.
     Incidental findings include calcification of the abdominal aorta.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Near complete loss of height of the L1 vertebral body with
     retropulsion into the spinal canal. See above

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pre op eval

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Intractable back pain.  History of CHF and coronary artery
     disease, compression fracture of L1.  Preoperative to lumbar laminectomy
     surgery scheduled [**3074-4-7**].
     
     AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in supine position on
     stretcher demonstrates status post sternotomy, and the presence of multiple
     surgical clips to the left of the midline are indicative of previous bypass
     surgery.  Also noted is the presence of 2 valve prostheses in aortic and
     mitral position.  They appeared to be of the St. [**Male First Name (un) **] type.  The heart is
     moderately enlarged.  The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated
     but no local contour abnormalities can be identified.  The pulmonary
     vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern, but there is no
     evidence of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema.  Sizable local pleural
     thickening is present along the right-sided lateral chest wall with extensive
     pleural calcifications.  This density extends into the lower lateral pleural
     sinus.  There is no evidence of acute pneumonic parenchymal infiltrates.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiac enlargement, status post bypass surgery and
     aortic and mitral valve replacement, mild chronic CHF but no signs of acute
     infiltrates.
     
     There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.

Neuro: Pt alert and oriented. Talked to her daughter on the phone. Refused pain med, only c/o slight headache.
Logrolled in bed for bedpan/turns and measured for back brace which will be delivered tomorrow.

Vital signs are stable. Pt is to be transferred to the floor when bed becomes available. Restarted on her coumadin as ordered. Taking pills PO but does cough after and has some difficulty getting them down due to needing to lay flat.

I have opted not to feed her due to the possibility of aspiration. Pt is on IVF NS w/20meq Kcl at 80cc/hr. Voids well on bedpan. repeat K at noon was up to 3.1 and pt continues to get IV potassium through maintenance IV.
