Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1045**] 
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right renal artey embolization [**2957-7-26**]
Thoracentesis [**2957-8-1**]
Arterial line placement

 
History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo male with DM, CRI, dementia, CVA, seizure 
disorder, and recent MVA who was originally transferred from an 
OSH for a right perinephric hematoma which he suffered from a 
twisting motion while getting out of bed.  He was originally 
admitted to trauma surgery where he had an embolization of one 
of the branches of the right renal artery done by IR.  His 
hematocrit remained stable.
.
His course was complicated by a worsening pleural effusion 
thought to be [**12-23**] lymphatic tracking originating from the 
perinephric space.  A therapeutic tap of 1500mL of 
serosanguinous fluid was done because he desaturated to 89% on 
RA.  Other complications include elevated troponins to 0.22 with 
normal CK and CKMB, and new TWI in V1-V3.  No report of chest 
pain.
.
Then he was admitted to the MICU for mental status change.  He 
remained hemodynamically stable and is now transferred to the 
regular floors for further management.
 
Past Medical History:
1) Diabetes type 2  
2) HTN  
3) CRI (baseline 2.4),  
4) CHF
5) CVA   
6) Seizure disorder on Keppra,  
7) Emphysema

Social History:
Lives with wife, had apparently been doing all ADL's with good 
independence before admission. No alcohol use since [**2952**] stroke, 
only drank socially before then. No tobacco or illicit drug use. 
 
Used to work as chemist.  

 
Family History:
Non-contributory, mother with PMR, cousin with epilepsy 
 
Physical Exam:
T 97.8 ax P 73 BP 161/67 RR 22 O2 100 on 2L NC  
Gen: Elderly Caucasian gentleman in NAD, drowsy at times  
Eyes: Sclerae anicteric  
Neck: Supple, no LND  
Mouth: MMM no lesions  
Chest: Scattered rhonchi in all fields, decreased air movement 
at bases.  
Heart: RR distant S1S2  
Abd: Flat NT, ND, nl bowel sounds.  
Ext: No edema  
Neurol: AOx2, not cooperative with neuro exam.  Toes mute.

 
Pertinent Results:
[**8-3**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
Large area of encephalomalacia in the region of the right 
posterior cerebral artery territory, secondary to an old 
infarct. No CT evidence to suggest acute major vascular 
territorial infarction, though if clinical suspicion is high for 
this entity, MRI would be more a superior diagostic imaging 
study. Other findings, as noted above.
.
[**8-4**] CXR: Persistent severe pulmonary edema with pleural 
effusions.
.
[**8-5**] CXR: Diffuse mild hydrostatic edema. Linear right 
infrahilar opacity is likely anterior segment right upper lobe 
atelectasis. Continued surveillance recommended. Stable right 
pleural effusion. Left lower lobe collapse also evident.
.
[**8-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with  normal cavity size 
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular  
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are  normal. The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. The aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild  (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly  
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation  is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate  pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic  pericardial 
effusion.  
.
[**8-9**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to a diffusely slowed record with two 

distinct patterns of slowing seen suggesting a moderate to 
moderately 
severe diffuse encephalopathy. No discharging features were 
seen. 
.
[**8-9**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe 
atelectasis, and moderate pulmonary edema have all worsened 
since [**8-6**]. Cardiac silhouette has enlarged in the 
interim, but not appreciably. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right 
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in their 
respective positions. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed 
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone at the time of dictation.
.
[**8-13**] CT chest: 1. Large bilateral pleural effusions and 
compressive atelectasis of the majority of the lower lobes of 
both lungs. Underlying infectious process within the atelectatic 
lung cannot be entirely excluded. Pleural effusions are not 
significantly changed in degree from [**2957-7-18**].
2. Subcapsular hemorrhage of the right kidney undergoing 
expected evolution but not changed insize from [**7-25**]. 
Embolization coils are noted near the renal hilum. If the 
patient is hypertensive, this may represent a Page kidney.
3. Left upper pole renal cyst with amorphous, but [**Known patient lastname **] 
calcifications, not entirely simple in appearance. Further 
evaluation with ultrasound (patient has a pacemeaker) is 
recommended as this lesion was not entirely imaged on this 
study.
4. Coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the 
aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo male with DM, CRI, dementia, prior strokes and seizure 
disorder admitted for perinephric hematoma s/p embolization now 
admitted to the medical floors with mental status changes. 
.
# MENTAL STATUS CHANGE - Patient's mental status improved 
signficantly after transfer to the floor.  The cause for his 
mental status changes was thought most likely secondary to ICU 
delerium and medication.   However, it was also thought that 
there could have been an effect of his high keppra dose and 
anticholinergic drugs.  There was no identifiable infection on 
blood cultures, CXRs, or urinalysis. His  EEG did not show any 
seizures.  An LP was not performed as clinical suspicion was 
low.  His Keppra was decreased to an appropriate renal dose and 
all of his medications with anticholinergic side effects were 
stopped. His Zoloft was held. He was initially given Haldol at 
night to control his evening agitation but it was later weaned 
off.  He was not requiring a 1:1 sitter at the time of discharge 
and was believed to be back close to his baseline level of 
dementia.
.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION - His first thoracentesis removed 1.5 L but 
the pleural fluid removed was not sent for diagnostic testing.  
He had reaccumulation of bilateral pleural effusions during the 
course of his admission. The differential for the effusion was 
CHF versus malignancy but it seemed less likely to be CHF given 
normal systolic function seen on ECHO [**8-5**].  His pleural 
effusion was tapped again on [**2957-8-17**] for diagnostic purposes and 
fluid was sent for analysis.  Fluid analysis was suggestive of 
transudate with LDH ratio of 0.3, total protein ratio of 0.3, 
fluid LDH of 185. Fluid also had 72,000 RBCs and 4 mesothelial 
cells.  There was concern for a malignant pleural effusion, 
possibly secondary to a mesothelioma not visualized on chest CT 
due to the large pleural effusions. At the time of discharge, 
the denied shortness of breath, had no other evidence on exam to 
suggest CHF besides pleural effusions, and had good O2 
saturations on minimal O2 requirements. Fluid cytology was 
pending at the time of discharge and patient's PCP was notified 
to follow up the results. 
.
# BACTEREMIA - He had a coagulase neg staph grow out of 1 of 4 
culture bottles on [**2957-8-3**] that was believed to be most likely a 
contaminant.  All subsequent cultures were negative and he 
remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission. 
.
# PERINEPHRIC HEMATOMA - He had embolization of one of the 
branches of his right renal artery by Interventional Radiology.  
He was hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit 
throughout his admission post-procedure.  His anticoagulation 
with warfarin was held. It was not restarted on discharge and he 
will follow up with his PCP to discuss when to restart.
.
# hypertension- patient was hypertensive to the 190s on the 
floor on beta blocker and long acting nitrate.  Given his renal 
insufficiency and likelihood of requiring large doses of ACE 
inhibitor to obtain appropriate blood pressure control, he was 
started on po hydralazine with excellent improvement in 
pressures.  He was discharged on metoprolol, Imdur, and 
hydralazine.  However, given QID dosing, patient may benefit 
from switch to calcium channel blocker as an outpatient.
.
# CVA - he was on warfarin and aspirin prior to his perinephric 
hematoma for stroke.  Given his risk of falls and hematoma, only 
his aspirin was continued and his warfarin was held.   
.
# BPH - He was continued on his finesteride and flomax.
.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN - His troponin peaked at 0.22 with no 
elevations in CK or CK/MB, and he had no chest pain.  He had EKG 
changes that were initially concerning for STEMI. However, 
cardiology reviewed the EKGs and did not feel that the EKG 
changes were consistent with acute coronary syndrome.  The 
troponin elevation was most likely given his known chronic renal 
insufficiency.  His CAD was treated conservatively with medical 
management including asa, metoprolol and isosorbide.  
.
# DM - His oral hypoglycemics were held during admission and he 
was managed with an insulin sliding scale.  His BGs remained 
well controlled throughout admission.  He was not restarted on 
his glipizide given his renal failure but was started on low 
dose avandia at the time of discharge.
.
# SEIZURE D/O - His keppra was decreased to 250 mg daily for 
appropriate renal dosing.  He had no episodes of seizure 
activity. His EEG did not show any evidence of seizure activity. 

.
# CRI - His renal function remained stable at his baseline of 
2.1 to 2.3.  
.
# SPEECH AND SWALLOW - He was evaluated by speech and swallow.  
His PO meds needed to be crushed in puree. Liquid forms were 
requried if medications were not crushable.  He was put on 
aspiration precautions, and all his meals needed to be 
supervised.

      84 year old man with R Renal Hemorrhage                                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R Renal Hemorrhage.  Please selectively embolize R kidney.  If total 
      embolization will be needed please contact trauma [**Hospital Unit Name **] as will take to OR for

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this
                                                                 (Over)

     stage there were two options, terminating the procedure because the finding
     was not absolute, or considering coil embolization of the subsegment. Because
     there was little down side to the embolization (in which very little renal
     parenchymal loss would occur) we elected to proceed. Via the Tracker catheter,
     embolization was performed with a single microcoil approximately 3 mm in
     diameter.
     
     Post-procedure arteriography of the right kidney no longer demonstrated the
     area in question (pseudoaneurysm versus active extravasation).
     
     Of note on the day arteriogram, there was marked compression of the renal
     contour by the known subcapsular hematoma.
     
     The catheter was removed, hemostasis was obtained and the patient returned to
     the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Initial flush abdominal arteriogram followed by selective right
     renal arteriogram and third-order arterial embolization for recurrent massive
     right renal hemorrhage resulting in a large compressive subcapsular hematoma.
     No complications.

      84 year old man with R Renal Hemorrhage                                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R Renal Hemorrhage.  Please selectively embolize R kidney.  If total 
      embolization will be needed please contact trauma [**Hospital Unit Name **] as will take to OR for

     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this
                                                                 (Over)

     stage there were two options, terminating the procedure because the finding
     was not absolute, or considering coil embolization of the subsegment. Because
     there was little down side to the embolization (in which very little renal
     parenchymal loss would occur) we elected to proceed. Via the Tracker catheter,
     embolization was performed with a single microcoil approximately 3 mm in
     diameter.
     
     Post-procedure arteriography of the right kidney no longer demonstrated the
     area in question (pseudoaneurysm versus active extravasation).
     
     Of note on the day arteriogram, there was marked compression of the renal
     contour by the known subcapsular hematoma.
     
     The catheter was removed, hemostasis was obtained and the patient returned to
     the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Initial flush abdominal arteriogram followed by selective right
     renal arteriogram and third-order arterial embolization for recurrent massive
     right renal hemorrhage resulting in a large compressive subcapsular hematoma.
     No complications.

     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this
                                                                 (Over)

     stage there were two options, terminating the procedure because the finding
     was not absolute, or considering coil embolization of the subsegment. Because
     there was little down side to the embolization (in which very little renal
     parenchymal loss would occur) we elected to proceed. Via the Tracker catheter,
     embolization was performed with a single microcoil approximately 3 mm in
     diameter.
     
     Post-procedure arteriography of the right kidney no longer demonstrated the
     area in question (pseudoaneurysm versus active extravasation).
     
     Of note on the day arteriogram, there was marked compression of the renal
     contour by the known subcapsular hematoma.
     
     The catheter was removed, hemostasis was obtained and the patient returned to
     the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Initial flush abdominal arteriogram followed by selective right
     renal arteriogram and third-order arterial embolization for recurrent massive
     right renal hemorrhage resulting in a large compressive subcapsular hematoma.

      84 year old man with R Renal Hemorrhage                                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R Renal Hemorrhage.  Please selectively embolize R kidney.  If total 
      embolization will be needed please contact trauma [**Hospital Unit Name **] as will take to OR for 
      nephrectomy

     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this
                                                                 (Over)

     stage there were two options, terminating the procedure because the finding
     was not absolute, or considering coil embolization of the subsegment. Because
     there was little down side to the embolization (in which very little renal
     parenchymal loss would occur) we elected to proceed. Via the Tracker catheter,
     embolization was performed with a single microcoil approximately 3 mm in
     diameter.
     
     Post-procedure arteriography of the right kidney no longer demonstrated the
     area in question (pseudoaneurysm versus active extravasation).
     
     Of note on the day arteriogram, there was marked compression of the renal
     contour by the known subcapsular hematoma.
     
     The catheter was removed, hemostasis was obtained and the patient returned to
     the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Initial flush abdominal arteriogram followed by selective right
     renal arteriogram and third-order arterial embolization for recurrent massive
     right renal hemorrhage resulting in a large compressive subcapsular hematoma.
     No complications.

     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this

      84 year old man with R Renal Hemorrhage                                         
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

     This is a redictation of a study from [**2957-7-26**].  The original dictation was by
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].
     
     HISTORY:  Large subcapsular hematoma involving the right kidney, spontaneous.
     Please assess for source of bleeding, embolize if possible.
     
     TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, the right common
     femoral region was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The Seldinger
     technique was used to obtain access to the right common femoral artery after
     which a 5 French vascular sheath was placed.  Initially, a flush abdominal
     arteriogram was performed to identify the origin of both the left and right
     renal arteries.  Note was made of some atherosclerotic change throughout the
     abdominal aorta as well as both iliac arteries.
     
     A C2 Glide catheter was advanced and selective arteriography of the right main
     renal artery performed. This demonstrated a [**Known patient lastname **] persisitent contrast
     collection felt to represent either a pseudoaneurysm or tiny contained
     extravasation within the mid portion the right kidney.
     
     Through the C2 catheter, a Tracker catheter was advanced and sequential
     selective arteriography of at least three intra-renal segmental third-order
     branches of the right kidney was performed, in an attempt to isolate the exact
     site of the [**Known patient lastname **] collection. This allowed isolation of the third- order
     branch felt to be the origin of this patient's subcapsular hematoma. At this

     stage there were two options, terminating the procedure because the finding
     was not absolute, or considering coil embolization of the subsegment. Because
     there was little down side to the embolization (in which very little renal
     parenchymal loss would occur) we elected to proceed. Via the Tracker catheter,
     embolization was performed with a single microcoil approximately 3 mm in
     diameter.
     
     Post-procedure arteriography of the right kidney no longer demonstrated the
     area in question (pseudoaneurysm versus active extravasation).
     
     Of note on the day arteriogram, there was marked compression of the renal
     contour by the known subcapsular hematoma.
     
     The catheter was removed, hemostasis was obtained and the patient returned to
     the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Initial flush abdominal arteriogram followed by selective right
     renal arteriogram and third-order arterial embolization for recurrent massive
     right renal hemorrhage resulting in a large compressive subcapsular hematoma.
