                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient is day 17 post OLT.   Rising LFTs.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color flow and pulse-wave Doppler sonography of the
     liver and its vasculature was performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  The study is compared to the examination from [**3225-10-3**].
     
     REPORT:  The liver is of slightly increased echogenicity. This is a
     nonspecific finding.  No focal hepatic masses are identified.  Status post
     cholecystectomy.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation and
     the common bile duct measures approximately 4 to 5 mm.
     
     There is evidence, in the region of the gallbladder fossa of a 2.7 x 3.5 cm
     mixed echogenicity lesion. This is well encapsulated, and is largely
     hypoechoic with a focal hyperechoic center.  It likely represents a resolving
     hematoma or postsurgical change.
     
     DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY:  The left, right, and main hepatic arteries, intrahepatic
     veins and left common, main and anterior and posterior branches of the right
     portal veins are all identified and appear normal.  No evidence of Doppler
     abnormalities identified.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Normal study.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Status post liver transplant, now with elevated LFTs.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with the prior study dated [**3225-10-26**].
     
     No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  Within the right lobe of the liver
     in segment 6, there is a 5.7 x 5.4 cm geographic area of increased
     echogenicity without hypervascularity, which, in retrospect, was present on
     the prior study dated [**3225-10-26**].  This area of increased echogenicity may
     represent an area of contusion related to surgery, and could be followed on
     future examinations.
     
     The main, left and right portal veins are widely patent with appropriate
     hepatopetal blood flow.  The hepatic venous branches are likewise widely
     patent.
     
     The main hepatic artery, left and right hepatic artery branches are widely
     patent.  Resistive indices within the main hepatic artery, right and left
     hepatic artery measure 0.7, 0.75, and 0.70 respectively.
     
     The pancreatic head and body are unremarkable; however, the pancreatic tail is
     not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Widely patent arterial and venous supply within the liver with appropriate
     resistive indices within the hepatic artery.
     
     2.  Geographic area of increased echogenicity within the right lobe of the
     liver, possibly representing a small contusion.  Clinical correlation is
     advised, and if desired, this finding could be followed on future
     examinations.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      58 year old man with elevatedLFT's s/p liver transplant
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt sp liver transplant 2 months ago, now with elevated LFT's./ Recent ERCP
      showed no bile leak but some discrepancy in size btw donor and native bile
      duct. Please assess. No stent in place. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Post liver transplant, now with rising LFTs.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial T1 in and out of phase, coronal HASTE, axial HASTE, axial
     STIR, axial time-of-flight, coronal thick slab HASTE, and axial high-
     resolution 3D gradient echo fat sat T1 images were obtained through the
     abdomen, concentrating on the liver and biliary tree.  No IV contrast was
     administered secondary to inability to obtain access.
     
     Comparison is made to ultrasound examinations from [**3225-11-26**], [**3225-10-20**], and from ERCP dated [**3225-11-13**].
     
     MRCP WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Since the ERCP of [**3225-11-13**], there has been
     interval decompression of the distal extrahepatic bile duct.  There is no
     intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The region of the choledocho-choledocho
     anastomosis is not definitively identified due to a surrounding lobulated
     fluid collection measuring approximately 5.5 x 5 x 3 cm.  The walls of this
     collection are thin but show clumped internal low signal consistent with
     debris. It is not possible to determine if this collection is connected to the
     biliary system.  Since it is not seen on ERCP from [**3225-11-13**], it is
     likely an extrabiliary collection.
     
     There is no free fluid seen around the liver hilum or within the abdomen.
     There is no evidence of solid or cystic liver lesion/mass. Normal signal is
     seen within the pancreas and kidneys.  There is a 4 x 3.4 x 8.1 (SI, AP,
     transverse) subdiaphragmatic, perihepatic hematoma along the
     superior/posterior portion of the right liver.  Fluid is still seen within the
     surgical incision.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval decompression of the distal extrahepatic common duct.
     
     2.  Lobulated fluid collection surrounding the biliary anastomosis.  This
     collection appeared to be present on the ultrasound dated 4 o'clock 2004. ERCP
     findings suggest that it is not connected to the biliary tree. HIDA scan could
     be useful for confirmation.  Although the biliary anastamosis is not
     identified the lack of intrahepatic biliary dilatation and lack of interval
     formation of free abdominal fluid strongly argues against an anastomotic
     breakdown.
     
     I discussed these findings with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1081**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1082**] via telephone on [**11-26**]

     Posterosuperiorly is identified a perihepatic fluid collection, known from MR
     to have complex characteristics consistent with hematoma and noted on CT to
     have some dependent layering density, also consistent with hematoma.
     Corresponding to the recent MR examination, there is evidence of a fluid
     collection identified adjacent to the bile ducts.  This contains some
     innterposed fat, which represents the debris seen on MR examination.  There is
     no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The bile ducts and
     choledochojejunostomy anastomosis are not well seen.  No other collection is
     identified on CT.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.  Corresponding to CT examination from [**3225-4-17**],
     there is traumatic injury to the right iliac bone.  Normal prostate, bladder,

     Admitting Diagnosis: S/P LIVER TRANSPLANT;BILIARY OBSTRUCTION
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      58 year old man with recent liver transplant. Now with rising alk phos. Liver
      bx suggests obstruction. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      rising LFTs s/p liver transplant
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 58 year old with recent liver transplant, now with rising
     alkaline phosphatase.
     
     Fluoroscopic assistance was provided to the gastroenterologist without a
     radiologist present. 17 spot images are provided for interpretation.
     
     FINDINGS:
     There is a size mismatch of the native and donor common bile ducts with mild
     dilation of the native common bile duct. The donor common bile duct is normal
     in appearance. Several small sacular areas are seen in the region of the
     proximal native common bile duct which were not appreciated on the prior
     study. However, these are present on an MRI performed [**3225-11-26**]. The
     intrahepatic ducts demonstrate areas of narrowing and dilation. No filling
     defects are identified. There is no mass.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Size mismatch between the native and donor common bile ducts with mild
     dilation of the native common bile duct. Pruning and dilation of the
     intrahepatic ducts suggests a cholangitis or PSC-type process.

     INDICATION:  58 year old liver transplant patient with rising liver function
     tests.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
     the pubic symphysis following the administration of 100 cc of Visipaque.
     Visipaque was used due to patient renal insufficiency.  Images were obtained
     in the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases.
     
     Multiplanar reformatted images were created.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3225-11-28**].
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases
     again demonstrate patchy opacification within the right middle lobe,
     concerning for infection.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.  The
     liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement throughout.  Portal vein, hepatic
     arteries, and hepatic veins are patent.  There is now mild central biliary
     ductal dilatation, a finding which is not appreciated in the prior noncontrast
     exam.  There is a stable appearing 4.0 x 8.6 cm posterior subphrenic fluid
     collection with high density material within it consistent with clot.  In
     addition, there is a stable appearing 4.3 x 4.4 cm hepatic hilar fluid
     collection containing fat.  The extrahepatic portion of the bile duct and the
     choledochocholedochal anastomosis is not well appreciated.  Extensive
     postoperative changes are present along the anterior abdominal wall with fluid
     within the rectus muscles.  The spleen is normal in appearance.  The pancreas
     is markedly atrophic.  The adrenal glands and kidneys appear grossly normal.
     There is a calcified left lower pole renal lesion which likely represents a
     cyst.  There are tiny bilateral low attenuation renal foci which are too small
     to characterize further.  The stomach and visualized loop of small and large
     bowel ate unremarkable.  The aorta and its major intra-abdominal branches are
     patent.  There is no free air.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters,
     seminal vesicles and prostate gland are within normal limits.  Pelvic loops of
     bowel are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid or air.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There is a probable healed fracture of the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 198**].
     The osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.

     Gadolinium contrast.  Subtracted and multiplanar reformatted images were

     FINDINGS:  There is abnormal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation which is
     at least moderate in severity, particularly in the the setting of liver
     transplantation.  The common hepatic duct is followed to the region of the 4.3
     x 3.0 cm fluid collection in the region of the biliary anastomosis.  The
     distal (presumably native) common bile duct is within normal limits, but a 1.5

     is not seen.  The fluid collection adjacent to the biliary anastomosis is
     slightly smaller on today's study, but the amount of fluid tracking into the
     region of the falciform ligament has increased in the interval.  No focal
     hepatic mass is seen.
     
     There is a small right pleural effusion.  Multiple small simple renal cysts
     are present bilaterally.  The kidneys demonstrate prompt and symmetric
     contrast enhancement.  The pancreas is somewhat atrophic.  The adrenal glands,
     spleen, and visualized portions of bowel are unremarkable.  There are
     postsurgical changes within the anterior abdominal wall, with fluid still seen
     within the surgical inscision site.

     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain, evaluate for common bile duct anastomotic
     stricture, status post liver transplantation.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRCP of the liver at 3-Tesla including 3D FR FSE and
     HASTE imaging sequences.  Multiplanar and MIP reformatted images were
     generated on an external workstation.
     
     FINDINGS:  3D MRCP imaging sequences provide better evaluation of the
     extrahepatic biliary system.  There is narrowing within the mid common bile
     duct, likely at the site of surgical anastomosis.  The native common bile duct
     is mildly prominent measuring 10 mm in diameter.  The transplant common bile
     duct is also mildly prominent measuring up to 9 mm in diameter.  There is
     intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  Multiple intrahepatic biliary
     strictures are seen, particularly within the more central portion of the
     intrahepatic ducts on both the right and left.  Incidentally noted is a cystic
     duct remnant.  The fluid collection adjacent to the biliary anastomosis
     tracking along the falciform ligament is unchanged compared to [**3225-12-17**].  Postsurgical changes and small collections within the anterior
     abdominal wall are partially imaged, but appear unchanged.
     
     Generation of MIP and multiplanar reformatted images was essential.
     
     IMPRESSIONS:  1.  Narrowing within the mid common bile duct, likely at the
     side of surgical anastomosis. Compared to prior ERCP there is no
     significant mismatch in caliber between donor and native CBD. This suggests
     dilatation of native CBD during prior ERCP due to injection of contrast
     against stenosis at the anastomosis.
     
     2.  Dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts on both the right and left with
     multiple intrahepatic biliary ductal strictures, particularly within the
     central portion of the intrahepatic ducts.
     
     3.  Unchanged fluid collection adjacent to the CBD anastomosis and tracking
     along the falciform ligament.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  A 58-year-old man with recent liver transplant, now with rising
     liver function tests.  Recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and sludge extraction.
     Rule out biliary obstruction.
     
     Comparison is made with a prior ERCP dated [**3225-12-2**].
     
     ERCP:  Nine images were provided for radiology interpretation.  ERCP was
     performed by the gastroenterologist under fluoroscopic guidance.  No
     radiologist was present during the image acquisition.
     
     Proximal portion of the common bile duct is moderately dilated.  There is
     approximately 5-mm stricture within the middle-third of the common bile duct,
     which is preceded by a focal area of dilatation.  Presumably, this is at the
     site of anastomosis.  This is in accordance with prior reports, which
     demonstrate size mismatch between the native and donor common bile ducts.
     
     A biliary stent is seen extending across the area of stricture within images
     #8 and #9.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Common bile duct stricture, with focus of proximal dilatation, presumably at
     the site of anastomosis.  Biliary stent was placed across the area of the
     stricture.

     LIVER BIOPSY BY RADIOLOGIST:  The potential risks and benefits of the
     procedure were explained in detail with the patient.  Signed consent was then
     obtained.  A preprocedure timeout was employed to verify the patient's
     identity and the planned biopsy site.
     
     Using sonographic localization, an appropriate spot on the skin was marked for
     the biopsy.  The area was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 1% lidocaine.  Using continuous
     sonographic guidance, a single core biopsy of the liver was obtained with an
     18-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any
     immediate post-procedure complications.  The specimen was immediately
     transported to pathology for further analysis.
     
     Conscious sedation was utilized, under continuous hemodynamic monitoring by

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status-post liver transplant with abdominal pain and
     fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Following the administration of intravenous and oral contrast,
     contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases thru the symphysis
     pubis.  The current study is compared to a prior examination dated [**3225-12-2**].
     Multiplanar reformatted images were created from the original data set.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lung bases demonstrates patchy consolidations
     within the right middle lobe, consistent with  pneumonia.  These appear
     unchanged from the prior examination.  No pleural or pericardial lesions are
     present.
     
     On the current examination, the liver is heterogeneous with several areas of
     triangular-shaped perfusion abnormalities.  These involve segments [**8-21**], parts
     of 6/7, as well as part of segment 4.  No focal parenchymal lesions are
     identified.  The portal vein, hepatic arteries, and hepatic veins appear
     widely patent.  Areas of low density are present adjacent to the main portal
     vein and its branches.  This is somewhat more prominent than on the prior
     examination, and may represent dilatation of the hepatic duct system and/or
     periportal edema. The triangular perfusion abnormalities which appear centered
     around the ductal system likely represents cholangitis in light of the normal-
     appearing vessels. As noted on the prior examination, there is a periportal
     fluid collection. It is stable in size, however, there is now mildly increased
     peripheral enhancement. Additionally, there is minimally increased fluid
     adjacent to the ligamentum teres.  If a biliary leak is suspected, a HIDA scan
     may be obtained for evaluation.  On the current examination, there is now a
     biliary duct stent. The posterior subphrenic fluid collection is unchanged in
     appearance.
     
     The pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen are normal in appearance.  There is
     no evidence of hydronephrosis.  Multiple hypodense lesions are identified
     within the left kidney, the largest located in the upper pole, measures 1 cm
     in size.  A partially calcified cyst is present in the lower pole of the left
     kidney.
     
     Fluid within both the rectus abdominus muscles and adjacent stranding is
     unchanged in appearance.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status-post liver transplant with abdominal pain and
     fever.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Following the administration of intravenous and oral contrast,
     contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases thru the symphysis
     pubis.  The current study is compared to a prior examination dated [**3225-12-2**].
     Multiplanar reformatted images were created from the original data set.
     
     FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the lung bases demonstrates patchy consolidations
     within the right middle lobe, consistent with  pneumonia.  These appear
     unchanged from the prior examination.  No pleural or pericardial lesions are
     present.
     
     On the current examination, the liver is heterogeneous with several areas of
     triangular-shaped perfusion abnormalities.  These involve segments [**8-21**], parts
     of 6/7, as well as part of segment 4.  No focal parenchymal lesions are
     identified.  The portal vein, hepatic arteries, and hepatic veins appear
     widely patent.  Areas of low density are present adjacent to the main portal
     vein and its branches.  This is somewhat more prominent than on the prior
     examination, and may represent dilatation of the hepatic duct system and/or
     periportal edema. The triangular perfusion abnormalities which appear centered
     around the ductal system likely represents cholangitis in light of the normal-
     appearing vessels. As noted on the prior examination, there is a periportal
     fluid collection. It is stable in size, however, there is now mildly increased
     peripheral enhancement. Additionally, there is minimally increased fluid
     adjacent to the ligamentum teres.  If a biliary leak is suspected, a HIDA scan
     may be obtained for evaluation.  On the current examination, there is now a
     biliary duct stent. The posterior subphrenic fluid collection is unchanged in
     appearance.
     
     The pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen are normal in appearance.  There is
     no evidence of hydronephrosis.  Multiple hypodense lesions are identified
     within the left kidney, the largest located in the upper pole, measures 1 cm
     in size.  A partially calcified cyst is present in the lower pole of the left
     kidney.
     
     Fluid within both the rectus abdominus muscles and adjacent stranding is
     unchanged in appearance.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  A 59-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplantation.
     MRCP performed on [**3225-12-18**] demonstrated multiple intrahepatic biliary
     strictures.  The findings were consistent with a preservation injury to the
     liver.  The patient now requires percutaneous biliary drainage.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 14978**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 7065**], MD
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 654**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 1221**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     
     The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient and an
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the angiography
     suite and placed in supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in
     the standard sterile fashion.  At this time, a timeout was performed and
     proper identification of the patient and the procedure were confirmed.  Based
     on the findings of the MRCP, we decided to attempt a right-sided percutaneous
     biliary tube.  The attention was then turned to the right upper quadrant.
     Ultrasound and fluoroscopy were used to select the best spot for the puncture,
     which was deemed to be in the 11th intercostal space.  Local anesthesia was
     given in the area with lidocaine 1%.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 21-gauge
     Chiba needle was passed 3 times before opacification of the biliary tree was
     seen.  The biliary tree was dominant.  There was no evidence of intrahepatic
     biliary dilatation.  However, multiple stenosis throughout the biliary tree at
     multiple levels were seen in this small duct.  The common bile duct was normal
     and there was stent located within the common bile duct with the tip probably
     in the right hepatic duct and the other tip in the duodenum.  There was prompt
     emptying of contrast within the duodenum.  This suggests that the stent is
     working properly.  There was one slightly larger right hepatic duct; we then
     attempted to access this duct.
     
     After several attempts, we were able to produce the needle in that small right
     duct.  Contrast injected through the needle demonstrated opacification of the
     biliary tree.  However, we were unable to advance a wire through the biliary
                                                                 (Over)

     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7065**], and at the time of
     interpretation, we decided to abort the procedure.

      59 year old man s/p OLT [**3225-10-3**] c/b anastomotic stricture, s/p ERCP & stent 
      [**12-18**] - readmitted with elevated LFTS, AlkPhos
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate for potential PTC

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  A 59-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplantation.
     MRCP performed on [**3225-12-18**] demonstrated multiple intrahepatic biliary
     strictures.  The findings were consistent with a preservation injury to the
     liver.  The patient now requires percutaneous biliary drainage.
     
     REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 14978**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 7065**], MD
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 654**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire procedure. Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 1221**] reviewed the exam.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
     
     The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient and an
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the angiography
     suite and placed in supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in
     the standard sterile fashion.  At this time, a timeout was performed and
     proper identification of the patient and the procedure were confirmed.  Based
     on the findings of the MRCP, we decided to attempt a right-sided percutaneous
     biliary tube.  The attention was then turned to the right upper quadrant.
     Ultrasound and fluoroscopy were used to select the best spot for the puncture,
     which was deemed to be in the 11th intercostal space.  Local anesthesia was
     given in the area with lidocaine 1%.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 21-gauge
     Chiba needle was passed 3 times before opacification of the biliary tree was
     seen.  The biliary tree was dominant.  There was no evidence of intrahepatic
     biliary dilatation.  However, multiple stenosis throughout the biliary tree at
     multiple levels were seen in this small duct.  The common bile duct was normal
     and there was stent located within the common bile duct with the tip probably
     in the right hepatic duct and the other tip in the duodenum.  There was prompt
     emptying of contrast within the duodenum.  This suggests that the stent is
     working properly.  There was one slightly larger right hepatic duct; we then
     attempted to access this duct.
     
     After several attempts, we were able to produce the needle in that small right
     duct.  Contrast injected through the needle demonstrated opacification of the
     biliary tree.  However, we were unable to advance a wire through the biliary
                                                                 (Over)

     introduce a wire through the biliary tree.
     
     These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7065**], and at the time of
     interpretation, we decided to abort the procedure.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Nondilated biliary tree with innumerable focal stenosis of very small
     biliary ducts.

     fashion,  demonstrating that the biliary stent in the common bile duct is
     working.
     
     3) Unsuccessful attempt of percutaneous biliary drainage tube due to inability
     to advance the wire in very small bile duct.

     FINDINGS:
     
     Frontal and lateral films are provided for interpretation.  A PICC line is
     noted on the right with its tip in the right atrium.  Borderline cardiomegaly.
     Hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  There are increased
     interstitial and partially nodular opacities in the right lung that are
     more prominent on the current study.  There is no evidence of effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Interval development of patchy interstitial and nodular markings in the right
     lung, especially in the mid lower zones.  In the right clinical setting, it
     might represent developing infectious process.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison is made to prior studies from [**3225-12-17**].
     
     Today's study is limited by low lung volumes.  Cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are probably unchanged, allowing for technique.
     
     There is minimal prominence of markings in the right perihilar region and left
     retrocardiac area.  These may represent accentuation of normal markings
     secondary to submaximal inspiration.  They may also represent residual changes
     from late December.  No CHF or frank air space infiltrate is seen.  The
     lateral costophrenic angles are sharp without effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION: No definite acute change (see above comments regarding mild
     prominence of markings bilaterally).
     
     PA/lateral views would be helpful when possible.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and

     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old man s/p liver tx                                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy                                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted

     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left

     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was

     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old man s/p liver tx                                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy                                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with

     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old man s/p liver tx                                                    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy                                                           
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess ductal anatomy

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with
     a total of 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  Initially, it was decided to attempt access
     through the right hepatic duct.  A 21-gauge Chiba needle was then inserted
     into the mid axillary line into the hepatic parenchyma.  The needle was
     withdrawn slowly with injection of contrast.  A bile duct was identified and
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     contrast was injected through the needle opacifying the biliary tree. However,
     the entrance site of the biliary was rather central, and it was decided to
     gain access in a more peripheral branch.  To secure this access, however, a
     0.018 Glidewire was introduced over the needle into the biliary tree and a
     needle was exchanged for a 3 French Accustick cannula.  With this, would be
     able to inject contrast at any time to opacify the biliary tree.  A right
     posterior duct was then chosen.  Using another 21-gauge Chiba needle, under
     fluoroscopic guidance, we were able to enter this right posterior duct
     peripherally with the needle.  A 0.018 Glidewire was was then advanced through
     the needle into the biliary tree.  It was then introduced more centrally,
     entering the common duct and eventually the duodenum.  The Chiba needle was
     then removed over the wire, and the 4 French Accustick system was then
     introduced over wire.  A 4 French Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire
     and placed in the duodenum.  The wire was exchanged for a Superstiff Amplatz
     wire.  The Accustick sheath was then removed, and a 7 French Bright-tip sheath
     was introduced over the wire and placed in the common duct.  The multiple
     strictures in the common duct and right main hepatic duct (please see Findings
     for a better description) were dilated using an 8 French x 4 cm balloon.
     
     Attention was then turned to the left side.  We were able to opacify the left
     hepatic duct with contrast from the right side.  Under fluoroscopic guidance,
     we were able to advance a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the left peripheral bile
     duct.  A 0.018 Glidewire was then advanced through the needle into the common
     duct and eventually into the duodenum.  The needle was exchanged for a 4
     French Accustick system.  Cobra catheter was advanced through the Accustick
     system over the wire and placed into the duodenum.  The wire was then
     exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff wire.  A 6 French Bright-tip sheath was
     then introduced over the wire. Antegrade cholangiogram was performed and
     multiple spot images were obtained (Findings described below). An 8-mm x 4-cm-
     long [**Hospital Unit Name **] LP balloon catheter was then introduced over the sheath and multiple
     strictures of the common duct and left hepatic duct were again dilated.
     
     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     INDICATION:  59-year-male status post liver transplant.  The patient had a
     prior percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram, which demonstrated multiple
     intrahepatic strictures (PFC-like).  In the prior study we  were not able to
     introduce percutaneous biliary catheters due to very small nondilated ducts.
     At that time the patient had the ERCP stent.  The ERCP stent was removed and
     the patient returns for bilateral PTBD placement.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) 654**] & [**Doctor Last Name 319**], with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, present during the entire procedure.
     
     ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under General Anesthesia by the
     anesthesiologist.  Approximately 16 cc of 1% Lidocaine was also injected into
     the site of the puncture for local anesthesia.
     
     CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was performed and proper identification of
     the patient and the procedure were confirmed. Local anesthesia was given with

     After multiple dilatations of the biliary tree, it was decided to place
     bilateral 10 French biliary catheters.  They were introduced easily over the
     wires, and the pigtail device of both sides of the catheters was deployed into
     the duodenum.  Contrast was then injected through both biliary catheters and
     proper positioning was confirmed with the side holes within the biliary tree.
     The catheters were affixed to the skin using 0-Silk and a Stat-lock device.
     The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
     
     FINDINGS:  Bilateral antegrade cholangiograms were performed, demonstrating a
     mildly dilated biliary system.  There are innumerable strictures throughout
     the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.  The strictures in the main
     ducts were successfully dilated with an 8-mm balloon.  Final biliary catheter
     cholangiogram demonstrates the drains in adequate position.
                                                                 (Over)

     CONCLUSION:
     1) Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic PFC-like biliary duct strictures.
     These are most likely related to the patient's history of preservation injury.
     
     2) Successful dilatation of multiple strictures in the right and left hepatic
     ducts and in common duct.
     
     3) Successful placement of bilateral 10 French Flexima biliary catheters.

     COMPARISON: [**3225-12-21**]
     
     TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT axial images were obtained through the abdomen
     and pelvis, with coronal and sagittal reformations.  IV contrast was not
     given.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again identified at the lung bases,
     there is bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions. There is diffuse ground
     glass opacity, greater on the right, which is largely unchanged from the prior
     study.  No paracardial fluid is seen.  We cannot assess the patency of the
     portal vein, hepatic arteries, and hepatic veins on this non-contrast study.
     Again identified are small low density fluid collections in the subhepatic
     space adjacent to the ligamentus teres and in the left subhepatic recess,
     which measure 2.2 x 2.5 and 1.4 x 1.4 cm respectively, which decreased in size
     from the prior study.  There remains mild diffuse fat stranding in the
     subhepatic recess.  There is no evidence of increasing fluid collection or
     abscess.  Additionally, there is subphrenic fluid collection, which appears to
     have decreased in size slightly from the prior study, and now measures
     approximately 3.6 x 5.8 cm.  Unchanged anterior abdominal wall fat stranding,
     consistent with post operative changes.  Interval placement of percutaneous
     transhepatic biliary stent.
     
     The pancreas, adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable.  The previously
     described renal cysts are not well appreciated on this non-contrast study.  A
     partially calcified cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney is again seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Oral contrast is seen to flow
     distally through to the rectum.  No signs of obstruction.  Sigmoid colon is
     unremarkable.  There is no free fluid within the pelvis.  The bladder is
     unremarkable.  Bony structures demonstrate no obvious abnormality.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Decreasing size of subhepatic and posterior subphrenic fluid collections

     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 251**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 294**]

     supervising throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.
     The left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
     Because no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
     compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. Hard
     copies of ultrasound images were obtained, documenting patent vein before and
     after establishing an access. 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy
     into the superior vena cava. Based on markers on the guidewire, it was
     determined that a length of 39 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed
     to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the superior vena cava. The sheath was removed and the catheter
     was flushed. A final chest x ray demonstrated the tip to be in the superior
     vena cava. The line is ready for use. A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was
     Hep locked. There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 39 cm long, dual lumen left sided PICC
     line with tip in the superior vena cava. The line is ready for use.

     Because no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
     compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial
     vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. Hard
     copies of ultrasound images were obtained, documenting patent vein before and
     after establishing an access. 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy
     into the superior vena cava. Based on markers on the guidewire, it was
     determined that a length of 39 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed
     to length and advanced over a 4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic
     guidance into the superior vena cava. The sheath was removed and the catheter
     was flushed. A final chest x ray demonstrated the tip to be in the superior
     vena cava. The line is ready for use. A Stat-Lock was applied and the line was
     Hep locked. There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 39 cm long, dual lumen left sided PICC
     line with tip in the superior vena cava. The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Evaluate placement of endoscopically placed feeding tube.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     A left-sided PICC terminates within the lower SVC.  Two internal/external
     biliary drainage catheters are identified within the right upper quadrant.  A
     feeding tube terminates within the proximal small bowel.  The heart size and
     mediastinal contours are unchanged compared to a prior study from [**3226-1-24**]. 
     There is hazy opacity within both lungs (left greater than right), may be
     improved when compared to [**3226-1-24**].  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions are
     seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  A feeding tube terminates within the proximal small bowel.
     
     2)  Improving subtle hazy pulmonary parenchymal opacity that could represent
     an improving atypical infection or pulmonary edema.  A PA and lateral chest
     radiograph would be helpful in further evaluating this finding.

     INDICATION:  This is a 59 year old male status post liver transplant.  This
     was complicated by multiple intra- and extrahepatic biliary strictures,
     supposedly due to preservation injury.  The patient had bilateral PTBDs placed
     on [**3225-1-27**].  At this time, multiple strictures were dilated with an

     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After prepping the tubes in the usual sterile fashion,
     approximately 60 cc of contrast was injected through the bilateral PTBDs and a
     tube cholangiogram was performed. This demonstrates that both drains are
     patent without evidence of obstruction. There are again noted multiple
     intrahepatic biliary strictures. There is interval decrease in the biliary
     duct dilatation. Now there is no evidence of biliary duct dilatation. The

      assess for clogged ptc tubes

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  This is a 59 year old male status post liver transplant.  This
     was complicated by multiple intra- and extrahepatic biliary strictures,
     supposedly due to preservation injury.  The patient had bilateral PTBDs placed
     on [**3225-1-27**].  At this time, multiple strictures were dilated with an
     8-mm balloon.  Now in the last couple of days, there is decrease in the
     drainage of the biliary catheters.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 654**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 251**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 156**], the Attending Radiologist, present
     and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After prepping the tubes in the usual sterile fashion,
     approximately 60 cc of contrast was injected through the bilateral PTBDs and a
     tube cholangiogram was performed. This demonstrates that both drains are
     patent without evidence of obstruction. There are again noted multiple
     intrahepatic biliary strictures. There is interval decrease in the biliary
     duct dilatation. Now there is no evidence of biliary duct dilatation. The
     common duct is very irregular. Contrast flows around the catheter with prompt
     emptying into the duodenum.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Both biliary drains are patent without evidence of obstruction.
     2) Interval decrease in the biliary duct dilatation.
     3) Innumerable intrahepatic biliary ductal strictures are unchanged when
     compared with the prior study.

     biliary drainage output.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
     the patient, and informed, written consent was obtained.  The patient was
     brought to the angiography suite, and placed supine on the table.  A pre-
     procedural time out was performed confirming the patient's identity and the
     procedure to be undertaken.
     
     Both PTBD's were prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately 40 cc of
     Optiray was injected through both PTBDs via slow hand injection.  Both PTBDs
     were in proper position, and both drains were patent without evidence of
     obstruction.  Again seen are multiple intrahepatic biliary strictures,
     unchanged from [**3226-2-6**].  There is no evidence of biliary duct dilatation.
     Contrast flowed freely from the intrahepatic biliary system through and around
     the drainage catheters, and into the small bowel.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from [**3226-2-6**].  Both PTBDs are
     patent without evidence of obstruction, and are in good position.  Unchanged

     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radilogist, was present during the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Approximately 15 cc of 1% lidocaine was administered in sites of
     the tubes. The patient also received 50 mg of fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed.
     
     CONSENT: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion. The preparation included drainage. At this time, a preprocedure
     timeout was performed and proper identification of the patient and the
     procedure was confirmed. Approximately 10 cc of nonionic IV contrast was
     injected through the left drain and a tube cholangiogram was performed which
     demonstrated good position of the drain with good drainage. There was no
     evidence of flow obstruction or malpositioning. There was no evidence of leak.
     
     The attention was then turned to the right drain. Approximately 15 cc of
     nonionic IV contrast was injected through the right drain. The right drain was
     malpositioned, and there was a side hole located probably outside of the
     biliary tree which was leaking. We then decided to exchange the tube to a new
     8 Fr biliary tube. Biliary tube was then cut and the pigtail device was
     released. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] wire was introduced through the tube and positioned within
     the duodenum. The tube was removed over the wire. A new 8 Fr biliary tube was
     then introduced. The pigtail device was deployed. The tube was fixed to the
     skin using 0 Prolene. Approximately 5 cc of nonionic IV contrast was injected,
     demonstrating good position of the tube with prompt drainage into the
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: This is a 59-year-old male status post liver transplant. This is
     complicated by preservation issue of the bile duct and multiple strictures
     throughout the bile ducts. Patient was submitted to bilateral PTBDs. Now the
     right tube is leaking, and the left tube is clogged.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 654**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**]. Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radilogist, was present during the entire procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Approximately 15 cc of 1% lidocaine was administered in sites of
     the tubes. The patient also received 50 mg of fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed.
     
     CONSENT: The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the
     patient and informed consent was obtained.
     
     PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed in
     supine position. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard sterile
     fashion. The preparation included drainage. At this time, a preprocedure
     timeout was performed and proper identification of the patient and the
     procedure was confirmed. Approximately 10 cc of nonionic IV contrast was
     injected through the left drain and a tube cholangiogram was performed which
     demonstrated good position of the drain with good drainage. There was no
     evidence of flow obstruction or malpositioning. There was no evidence of leak.
     
     The attention was then turned to the right drain. Approximately 15 cc of
     nonionic IV contrast was injected through the right drain. The right drain was
     malpositioned, and there was a side hole located probably outside of the
     biliary tree which was leaking. We then decided to exchange the tube to a new
     8 Fr biliary tube. Biliary tube was then cut and the pigtail device was
     released. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] wire was introduced through the tube and positioned within
     the duodenum. The tube was removed over the wire. A new 8 Fr biliary tube was
     then introduced. The pigtail device was deployed. The tube was fixed to the
     skin using 0 Prolene. Approximately 5 cc of nonionic IV contrast was injected,
     demonstrating good position of the tube with prompt drainage into the
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Feeding tube place by endoscopy today.  Check placement of post
     pyloric feeding tube.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single supine radiograph of the abdomen is provided.  Left and
     right sided biliary tubes are in place.  There is a catheter which appears to
     extend through the stomach and duodenum and then terminate within the jejunum.
     The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  The tip of the feeding tube overlies the expected location of the
     jejunum. Please note that the tube was not injected with contrast to confirm
     tube placement in the bowel lumen.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
     
     INDICATION:  Febrile patient with cough.  Evaluate chest.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     AP and lateral view of the chest have been obtained with the patient in semi-
     erect position.  The patient was unable to follow breathing instructions. The
     films are analyzed in direct comparison with the preceding portable chest
     examination dated [**3226-2-5**].  It is understood that the patient is
     status post liver transplant.  An NG tube is noted, and apparently unchanged
     in position reaching far below the diaphragm.  A left subclavian approach
     central venous line is noted terminating overlying the SVC at the level of the
     carina.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is within normal limits,
     considering AP technique.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  There
     exist, however, multiple patchy infiltrates in both lungs present in the right
     lung mid field and bilaterally in the lower lung fields.  The pleural spaces
     are free, and the same holds for the posterior pleural sinuses on the lateral
     view.
     
     Comparing the pulmonary infiltrates with the findings on the previous
     examination is somewhat difficult as the exposure techniques of these films
     differ considerably.  It is however quite clear that the patchy infiltrates
     have progressed from what was present on the previous examination.  Review of
     a more remote examination of [**3226-1-8**] demonstrated already the
     presence of some infiltrates in similar location; however, they have
     undoubtedly increased.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Progressing pulmonary infiltrates compatible with atypical pneumonitis.

     HISTORY:  59 year-old man status post liver transplant with malnutrition
     requiring dual-lumen PICC for long-term IV antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINS:  The procedure is performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 329**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 156**]
     (the Attending Radiologist) who was present and supervising throughout.  The
     patient's right upper arm was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
     After infusion of 1% Lidocaine the right brachial vein was accessed under
     ultrasonographic guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  Hardcopy ultrasound images
     were obtained before and after access.  An 018 wire was advanced into the SVC
     under flouroscopic guidance . Based on the marker on the guidewire it was
     determined that a length of 30 cm would be appropriate for the dual-lumen
     PICC.  The PICC was cut to fit and advanced over a 5-French introducer sheath.
     The wire and sheath were removed. The line was flushed and heplocked and
     secured with a statlock.  A final chest image demonstrated appropriate
     positioning of the PICC tip in the SVC.  The patient tolerated the procedure
     well and there were no immediate postprocedure complications.

     intake.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 329**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1278**], and [**Doctor Last Name 1746**].  The patient was
     placed supine on the fluoroscopy table.  After coating the 12 French feeding
     tube with lidocaine jelly, the tube was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance
     into the stomach.  The wire was withdrawn and 5 cc of contrast and 30 cc of
     air were administered to elucidate the location of the pylorus.  After
     reinserting the wire, the tube was advanced through the pylorus into the
     duodenum.  The tube was advanced to its tip at the level of the ligament of
     Treitz.  The wire was withdrawn and additional injection of 5 cc of contrast
     demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube tip at the distal
     duodenum/proximal jejunum.  The tube was secured with tape.  The patient
     tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post- procedure
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 12 French enteric feeding tube with tip at
     the level of the ligament of Treitz.

     with rising LFTs.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3226-1-26**].
     
     LIVER ULTRASOUND:  The liver echo texture is coarse and heterogeneous.  There
     is interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma.  The main
     hepatic artery, right and left hepatic arteries are patent.  The main portal
     vein is patent.  There is a thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the
     portal vein.  However, this finding is unchanged when compared to CT from
     [**3225-12-21**].  The left portal vein and the right posterior branch are
     patent.  There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver echotexture suggests
     parenchymal disease.
     2. Thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the portal vein is unchanged
     when compared to [**3226-12-21**].
     3. The main portal vein, left portal vein, and right posterior branch of the
     portal vein are patent.
     4. The hepatic artery is patent.

     HISTORY:  59 year old male status post liver transplant with elevated liver
     function tests.  Please perform cholangiography with possible catheter
     repositioning.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout.  Given the patient's mental status and the inability to locate the
     health care proxy, consent was implied.  The urgency and indications for the
     procedure were documented in the patient's chart prior to the start of the
     procedure.  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  His
     abdomen, including the bilateral biliary drainage catheters, was prepped and
     draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A fluoroscopic spot film of the
     abdomen was obtained, demonstrating the bilateral biliary drainage catheters
     to be appropriately positioned as compared with the previous examination.
     Through the right 8 French biliary drainage catheter, a cholangiogram was
     performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast.  This demonstrated a
     nondilated biliary tree with free and rapid passage of contrast into the bowel
     lumen beyond surgical anastomosis. Of note, blood clots were noted within the
     biliary tree. Some clots and blood stained bile could be aspirated. The
     contrast was then aspirated and our attention was turned to the left hepatic
     biliary drain.
     
     A tube cholangiogram was performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast
     through the indwelling left 8 French biliary drainage catheter.  This
     demonstrated the left hepatic drainage catheter to be in good position with no
     evidence of ductal dilatation.  Overall, these findings are unchanged from the
     previous study dated [**3226-2-20**].  After the cholangiogram was performed,
     the catheters were placed to external bag drainage.  Dry sterile dressings
     were applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  None.
     
     CONTRAST:  30 cc of 60% Optiray.

     PROCEDURE DATE:  [**3226-3-18**].
     
     HISTORY:  59 year old male status post liver transplant with elevated liver
     function tests.  Please perform cholangiography with possible catheter
     repositioning.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout.  Given the patient's mental status and the inability to locate the
     health care proxy, consent was implied.  The urgency and indications for the
     procedure were documented in the patient's chart prior to the start of the
     procedure.  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  His
     abdomen, including the bilateral biliary drainage catheters, was prepped and
     draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A fluoroscopic spot film of the
     abdomen was obtained, demonstrating the bilateral biliary drainage catheters
     to be appropriately positioned as compared with the previous examination.
     Through the right 8 French biliary drainage catheter, a cholangiogram was
     performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast.  This demonstrated a
     nondilated biliary tree with free and rapid passage of contrast into the bowel
     lumen beyond surgical anastomosis. Of note, blood clots were noted within the
     biliary tree. Some clots and blood stained bile could be aspirated. The
     contrast was then aspirated and our attention was turned to the left hepatic
     biliary drain.
     
     A tube cholangiogram was performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast
     through the indwelling left 8 French biliary drainage catheter.  This
     demonstrated the left hepatic drainage catheter to be in good position with no
     evidence of ductal dilatation.  Overall, these findings are unchanged from the
     previous study dated [**3226-2-20**].  After the cholangiogram was performed,
     the catheters were placed to external bag drainage.  Dry sterile dressings
     were applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  None.
     
     CONTRAST:  30 cc of 60% Optiray.
                                                                 (Over)

     with rising LFTs.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3226-1-26**].
     
     LIVER ULTRASOUND:  The liver echo texture is coarse and heterogeneous.  There
     is interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma.  The main
     hepatic artery, right and left hepatic arteries are patent.  The main portal
     vein is patent.  There is a thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the
     portal vein.  However, this finding is unchanged when compared to CT from
     [**3225-12-21**].  The left portal vein and the right posterior branch are
     patent.  There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver echotexture suggests
     parenchymal disease.
     2. Thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the portal vein is unchanged
     when compared to [**3226-12-21**].
     3. The main portal vein, left portal vein, and right posterior branch of the
     portal vein are patent.
     4. The hepatic artery is patent.

     INDICATION:  58 year old male status post liver transplant two months ago. Now
     with rising LFTs.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3226-1-26**].
     
     LIVER ULTRASOUND:  The liver echo texture is coarse and heterogeneous.  There
     is interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma.  The main
     hepatic artery, right and left hepatic arteries are patent.  The main portal
     vein is patent.  There is a thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the
     portal vein.  However, this finding is unchanged when compared to CT from
     [**3225-12-21**].  The left portal vein and the right posterior branch are
     patent.  There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Interval worsening of the heterogeneity of the liver echotexture suggests
     parenchymal disease.
     2. Thrombosis of the right anterior branch of the portal vein is unchanged
     when compared to [**3226-12-21**].
     3. The main portal vein, left portal vein, and right posterior branch of the
     portal vein are patent.
     4. The hepatic artery is patent.

     HISTORY:  59 year old male status post liver transplant with elevated liver
     function tests.  Please perform cholangiography with possible catheter
     repositioning.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout.  Given the patient's mental status and the inability to locate the
     health care proxy, consent was implied.  The urgency and indications for the
     procedure were documented in the patient's chart prior to the start of the
     procedure.  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  His
     abdomen, including the bilateral biliary drainage catheters, was prepped and
     draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A fluoroscopic spot film of the
     abdomen was obtained, demonstrating the bilateral biliary drainage catheters
     to be appropriately positioned as compared with the previous examination.
     Through the right 8 French biliary drainage catheter, a cholangiogram was
     performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast.  This demonstrated a
     nondilated biliary tree with free and rapid passage of contrast into the bowel
     lumen beyond surgical anastomosis. Of note, blood clots were noted within the
     biliary tree. Some clots and blood stained bile could be aspirated. The
     contrast was then aspirated and our attention was turned to the left hepatic
     biliary drain.
     
     A tube cholangiogram was performed via hand injection of nonionic contrast
     through the indwelling left 8 French biliary drainage catheter.  This
     demonstrated the left hepatic drainage catheter to be in good position with no
     evidence of ductal dilatation.  Overall, these findings are unchanged from the
     previous study dated [**3226-2-20**].  After the cholangiogram was performed,
     the catheters were placed to external bag drainage.  Dry sterile dressings
     were applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  None.
     
     CONTRAST:  30 cc of 60% Optiray.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After coating the weighted feeding tube with lidocaine
     jelly the tube was advanced from the right nostril into the stomach.   Air and
     conray were infused into the stomach to elucidate the pylorus.  The tube was
     then advanced under fluoroscopic guidance through the pylorus and into the
     duodenum.  The tube tip was positioned in the proximal jejunum.  Post
     placement injection of conray demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube
     tip past the ligament of Treitz in the proximal jejunum.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of nasojejunal feeding tube.

     jelly the tube was advanced from the right nostril into the stomach.   Air and
     conray were infused into the stomach to elucidate the pylorus.  The tube was
     then advanced under fluoroscopic guidance through the pylorus and into the
     duodenum.  The tube tip was positioned in the proximal jejunum.  Post
     placement injection of conray demonstrated appropriate positioning of the tube
     tip past the ligament of Treitz in the proximal jejunum.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of nasojejunal feeding tube.

      pt s/p liver transplant in clinic today with leaking right PTC caTh. Needs to
      be upsized. Please also place stitch in left PTC. Pt with right and left PTC in
      place for biliary stenosis. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035
                                                                 (Over)

      exit site.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt s/p liver transplant in clinic today with leaking right PTC caTh. Needs to
      be upsized. Please also place stitch in left PTC. Pt with right and left PTC in
      place for biliary stenosis. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

     COMPARISON:  [**3226-4-16**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fever.  Status post liver transplantation.
     
     The heart demonstrates left ventricular configuration.  The mediastinal and
     hilar contours are within normal limits for low lung volumes and portable
     technique.  Again, demonstrated is a bilateral interstitial pattern with
     poorly defined reticular and nodular opacities predominantly in the lung
     periphery.  Direct comparison is somewhat limited due to differences in
     technique between the two studies, but there has been a possible slight
     interval increase.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Peripheral reticular and nodular opacities with apparent slight
     interval increase compared to the previous study, concerning for worsening
     atypical infection.  Differential diagnosis includes a post-transplant
     lymphoproliferative disorder.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt s/p liver transplant in clinic today with leaking right PTC caTh. Needs to
      be upsized. Please also place stitch in left PTC. Pt with right and left PTC in
      place for biliary stenosis. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

      exit site.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt s/p liver transplant in clinic today with leaking right PTC caTh. Needs to
      be upsized. Please also place stitch in left PTC. Pt with right and left PTC in
      place for biliary stenosis. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035
                                                                 (Over)

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire, a separate #7 French bright tipped angiographic sheath was
     advanced.  After the inner dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was
     performed.  Again was noted ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of
     dilation or stricture within the left hepatic ducts.  The 7 French sheath was
     then removed and a new 8 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
     catheter was advanced until the tip was within the Roux limb.  After the
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg

     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed, the catheter pigtail was formed and locked.  The
     catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin using a
     0 silk suture.  A dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     At this time, the 7 French sheath was removed from the right hepatic duct and
     a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter was
     advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire into the Roux limb.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was then
     removed and the catheter pigtail was formed and locked, with the tip
     appropriately positioned beyond the surgical anastomosis within the Roux limb.
     The catheter was capped for internal drainage and was secured to the skin
     using a 0 silk suture.  A separate dry sterile dressing was applied.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     MEDICATIONS: 1 percent lidocaine.  Three grams of intravenous Unasyn. 1.5 mg
     of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl were administered in intermittent doses with
     continuous monitoring of vital signs by the nursing staff.
     
     CONTRAST:  40 cc of full strength Optiray 320.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Pull-back cholangiography revealed no evidence of biliary dilatation or
     stricture within the hepatic ducts bilaterally.  There is free and rapid
     passage of contrast beyond the surgical anastomosis into the Roux limb.
     
     2.  Replacement of a new 8 French drainage catheter via the left hepatic duct
     along with upsizing for a new 10 French biliary drainage catheter via the
     right hepatic duct.  Both catheters were capped for internal drainage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male status post liver transplant with bilateral biliary
     drains placed for bile duct stricture.  Patient presents for upsizing of the
     right drain with evaluation of both hepatic ducts.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the staff radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
     discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
     placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including the biliary
     drainage catheters, were prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
     Three grams of intravenous Unasyn was administered.  The skin and subcutaneous
     tissues surrounding the catheters was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film was obtained, demonstrating the catheters to be
     appropriately positioned.  In addition, a post-pyloric feeding tube is present
     within the bowel lumen. Each catheter was sequentially cut, releasing the
     locked pigtails and 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires were advanced through each of the
     indwelling catheter lumens into the Roux limb.  The indwelling catheters were
     removed.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire positioned in the right hepatic duct, a 7
     French bright tipped angiographic sheath was advanced.  After the inner
     dilator was removed, a pull-back cholangiogram was performed.  This revealed
     persistent ectasia of the common duct with no evidence of dilation in the
     right hepatic ducts.  No strictures were present.  There was free passage of
     contrast into the Roux limb beyond the surgical anastomosis.
     
     Our attention was then turned to the left biliary system.  Over the 0.035

     This report also refers to clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) 15023**].
     
     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man status post liver transplant presenting
     with poor p.o. intake and also right-sided leakage around percutaneous biliary
     drainage tube.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**] reviewed the exam.
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  With the patient sitting on a stretcher, local anesthetic spray
     and gel were used to anesthetize the nostril and oropharynx.  An 8-French
     nasal post-pyloric tube was then advanced through the right nostril.  The
     patient was then moved to the fluoroscopy table and the catheter was further
     advanced into the proximal jejunum under fluoroscopic guidance.  A final
     abdominal x-ray image was obtained documenting adequate position of the
     catheter.  Then, the right side of the abdomen and the indwelling biliary
     tubes were prepared in a sterile fashion.  Tube cholangiogram through the
     right biliary drainage catheter showed only opacification of the small bowel
     with no intrahepatic biliary ducts visualized.  The tube was slightly pulled
     back and good opacification of intrahepatic ducts was obtained.  These ducts
     did not appear dilated.  It was then realized that the leakage was probably
     due to the malposition of the tube which had side holes outside the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through
     the tube into the small bowel.  The tube was removed and a new 10-French
     biliary drainage catheter with additional proximal side holes, created to
     provide drainage of the right hepatic lobe was advanced over the wire all the
     way into the small bowel.  The pigtail was formed into the small bowel and a
     new contrast injection documented adequate drainage and opacification of the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 1-0
     silk stitch and the dressing was applied.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     This report also refers to clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) 15023**].
     
     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man status post liver transplant presenting
     with poor p.o. intake and also right-sided leakage around percutaneous biliary
     drainage tube.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**] reviewed the exam.
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  With the patient sitting on a stretcher, local anesthetic spray
     and gel were used to anesthetize the nostril and oropharynx.  An 8-French
     nasal post-pyloric tube was then advanced through the right nostril.  The
     patient was then moved to the fluoroscopy table and the catheter was further
     advanced into the proximal jejunum under fluoroscopic guidance.  A final
     abdominal x-ray image was obtained documenting adequate position of the
     catheter.  Then, the right side of the abdomen and the indwelling biliary
     tubes were prepared in a sterile fashion.  Tube cholangiogram through the
     right biliary drainage catheter showed only opacification of the small bowel
     with no intrahepatic biliary ducts visualized.  The tube was slightly pulled
     back and good opacification of intrahepatic ducts was obtained.  These ducts
     did not appear dilated.  It was then realized that the leakage was probably
     due to the malposition of the tube which had side holes outside the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through
     the tube into the small bowel.  The tube was removed and a new 10-French
     biliary drainage catheter with additional proximal side holes, created to
     provide drainage of the right hepatic lobe was advanced over the wire all the
     way into the small bowel.  The pigtail was formed into the small bowel and a
     new contrast injection documented adequate drainage and opacification of the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 1-0
     silk stitch and the dressing was applied.
     
                                                                 (Over)

      59 year old man with biliary stenosis s/p liver transplant                      
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please change lateral (Right) ptc for leaking at insertion site

                                     FINAL REPORT
     This report also refers to clip #[**Clip Number (Radiology) 15023**].
     
     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man status post liver transplant presenting
     with poor p.o. intake and also right-sided leakage around percutaneous biliary
     drainage tube.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and Dr.
     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2658**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2658**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**] reviewed the exam.
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  With the patient sitting on a stretcher, local anesthetic spray
     and gel were used to anesthetize the nostril and oropharynx.  An 8-French
     nasal post-pyloric tube was then advanced through the right nostril.  The
     patient was then moved to the fluoroscopy table and the catheter was further
     advanced into the proximal jejunum under fluoroscopic guidance.  A final
     abdominal x-ray image was obtained documenting adequate position of the
     catheter.  Then, the right side of the abdomen and the indwelling biliary
     tubes were prepared in a sterile fashion.  Tube cholangiogram through the
     right biliary drainage catheter showed only opacification of the small bowel
     with no intrahepatic biliary ducts visualized.  The tube was slightly pulled
     back and good opacification of intrahepatic ducts was obtained.  These ducts
     did not appear dilated.  It was then realized that the leakage was probably
     due to the malposition of the tube which had side holes outside the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through
     the tube into the small bowel.  The tube was removed and a new 10-French
     biliary drainage catheter with additional proximal side holes, created to
     provide drainage of the right hepatic lobe was advanced over the wire all the
     way into the small bowel.  The pigtail was formed into the small bowel and a
     new contrast injection documented adequate drainage and opacification of the
     intrahepatic biliary ducts.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 1-0
     silk stitch and the dressing was applied.
     
                                                                 (Over)

       59 year old man with biliary stenosis s/p liver transplant with [**Hospital Unit Name 664**]/lat ptc    
                     
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please assess lateral ptc. continues to leak at insertion site                  
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Biliary stenosis status post liver transplant.  The lateral
     (right) drain continues to leak at the insertion site.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7771**] [**Name (STitle) 7772**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**]
     [**Name (STitle) 128**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1543**] [**Name (STitle) 156**] present and supervising.  Risks and benefits
     of the procedure were explained to the patient and a written informed consent
     was obtained.  Initial scout examination revealed a right and left biliary
     drainage catheter in place.  30 cc of Optiray 320 was injected in the 10
     French percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter.  It appears to be
     in good position with no evidence of contrast leak or stricture formation. The
     contrast flows freely into the Roux limb.
     
     Some slight swelling was noted at the insertion site of the right drainage
     catheter.  Upon ultrasound examination, there was a small amount of edema in
     the subcutaneous tissue without evidence of a focal collection.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Right biliary drain in good position without evidence of leak.
     2)  Small amount of subcutaneous edema at the insertion site of the right
     drainage catheter without evidence of a focal collection.

     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]
     sterile dressing was applied.  
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.  
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1. Moderate stenosis just proximal to the surgical anastomotic site, with free
     flow of contrast into the Roux loop.  Area of stenosis dilated with 8, and 10
     mm balloons, with some improvement in flow.  
     2. Exchange of existing right 10 French and left 8 French percutaneous
     transhepatic biliary drainage catheters for new 10 French catheter on the
     right, and 8 French catheter on the left.

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]
     sterile dressing was applied.

     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1. Moderate stenosis just proximal to the surgical anastomotic site, with free

     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths

     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]
     sterile dressing was applied.  
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.  
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1. Moderate stenosis just proximal to the surgical anastomotic site, with free
     flow of contrast into the Roux loop.  Area of stenosis dilated with 8, and 10
     mm balloons, with some improvement in flow.  
     2. Exchange of existing right 10 French and left 8 French percutaneous
     transhepatic biliary drainage catheters for new 10 French catheter on the
     right, and 8 French catheter on the left.

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was
                                                                 (Over)

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]
     sterile dressing was applied.  
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.  
     
     ANESTHESIA:  General
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1. Moderate stenosis just proximal to the surgical anastomotic site, with free
     flow of contrast into the Roux loop.  Area of stenosis dilated with 8, and 10
     mm balloons, with some improvement in flow.  
     2. Exchange of existing right 10 French and left 8 French percutaneous
     transhepatic biliary drainage catheters for new 10 French catheter on the
     right, and 8 French catheter on the left.

     performed through each sheath.  This revealed non-dilated biliary ductal
     system, with short segment stricture just proximal to the anastomosis. We
     advanced an 8 mm x 3 cm balloon across the area of stenosis through the right
     bright tip sheath, followed by dilatation of the stricture with an 8 mm
     balloon through the left sheath.  Subsequent cholangiogram demonstrated
     partial opening of this stricture.  We then decided to advance a 10 mm balloon
     through the left sheath, across the area of stenosis.  Our final cholangiogram
     demonstrated partial re-opening of the stenotic area.   The bright tip sheaths
     where then exchanged for a new 10 French percutaneous transhepatic biliary
     drainage catheter on the right and an 8 French catheter on the left.  After
     the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was removed with the inner plastic stiffener the catheter
     pigtail was formed and locked within the Roux loop.  The catheters were capped
     for internal drainage and secured to the skin using 0 silk sutures.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 15029**]

     HISTORY:  59-year-old male S/P liver transplant, with two BDC internal and
     external drainage catheters.  Bile leak around exit site of right draining
     tube.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS
     
     The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 15028**] with Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**] Attending Radiologist presenting and supervising.  After explaining
     risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient a written informed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.  The
     area around the existing biliary drainage tubes was prepped and draped in
     standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed.  General
     endotracheal anesthesia was administered.
     
     A fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the catheter to be appropriately
     positioned.  Both drainage catheters were cut at the hub, releasing the
     pigtail, and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires advanced through each catheter into the Roux limb.
     The catheters were exchanged for a 6 French bright tip sheath with inner
     dilator.  The inner dilators were removed.  Pull back cholangiogram was

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The
     patient also received premedications on the floor before the procedure. Total
     of 130 mL of Optiray 320 (nonionic contrast).
     
     CONCLUSION: Bile duct dilatation with an 8 mm cutting balloon. Bilateral PTBD
     tubes were replaced, same as before (10-French on the right and 8-French on
     the left).

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The
     patient also received premedications on the floor before the procedure. Total
     of 130 mL of Optiray 320 (nonionic contrast).
     
     CONCLUSION: Bile duct dilatation with an 8 mm cutting balloon. Bilateral PTBD
     tubes were replaced, same as before (10-French on the right and 8-French on

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic

     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The
     patient also received premedications on the floor before the procedure. Total
     of 130 mL of Optiray 320 (nonionic contrast).
     
     CONCLUSION: Bile duct dilatation with an 8 mm cutting balloon. Bilateral PTBD
     tubes were replaced, same as before (10-French on the right and 8-French on
     the left).

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes

     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The
     patient also received premedications on the floor before the procedure. Total
     of 130 mL of Optiray 320 (nonionic contrast).
     
     CONCLUSION: Bile duct dilatation with an 8 mm cutting balloon. Bilateral PTBD
     tubes were replaced, same as before (10-French on the right and 8-French on
     the left).

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt s/p liver transplant with biliary strictures and 2 PTC's in place. Right
      catheter leaking large amount of fluid areound cath site. Needs a tube check.
      Will need IV levo pre procuedure.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 59-year-old man who is status post orthotopic liver
     transplantation on [**3225-10-3**], with known multiple intra- and extrahepatic
     biliary duct strictures. The patient is status post bilateral placement of
     internal and external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drains (PTBD) since
     [**3226-1-28**], and status post balloon dilation to 10 mm diameter on [**3226-5-8**]
     at the level of the common bile duct. Persistent, abundant bile leak around
     the right-sided PTBD.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1085**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], the staff radiologist, was present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent had been obtained prior to the
     procedure. The patient was placed supine on the table and his right and left
     PTBD tubes and surrounding skin were draped and prepped using sterile
     technique. A scout view of the right upper quadrant was first obtained,
     showing proper positioning of the bilateral biliary drains. Contrast was then
     injected successively in the left and right PTBD tubes with tube
     cholangiograms showing unchanged appearance of the intra and extrahepatic bile
     ducts as compared to the last examinations, with small, narrowed intrahepatic
     ducts and a common bile duct (CBD) of variable caliber. There was rapid
     passage of contrast from the CBD into the duodenum, where the pigtails of both
     biliary drains were located.
     
     Then, a 0.035 [**Name (STitle) 129**] guidewire was advanced through the right-sided PTBD tube
                                                                 (Over)

     into the duodenum and biliary tube was removed and exchanged for a 7-French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheath, the tip of which was placed in the duodenum. The same
     maneuver was repeated at the level of the left-sided access. Successive
     pullback cholangiograms were obtained on the right and then on the left side,
     by injecting contrast under fluoroscopy while pulling back slowly the 7-French
     sheaths. This showed two areas of focal narrowing located respectively in the
     mid portion of the CBD and in its distal portion, at the level of the ampulla.
     Just above and below the first stenosis (mid CBD), the caliber of the bile
     duct was relatively enlarged. A third area of narrowing was found at the hilum
     after further withdrawal of the [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip sheaths, and this involved the
     central portions of the right and left hepatic ducts.
     
     The 7-French sheath was readvanced with its dilator over the wire until its
     tip reached the duodenum, and dilator and 0.035 wire were removed. An 8 mm
     diameter cutting balloon was then advanced through the sheath and balloon
     dilation was performed serially along the bile ducts for periods of 1 minute
     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over

     at a pressure of 8 atmospheres.
     
     Control cholangiogram from each side showed rapid passage of contrast from the
     bile ducts into the duodenum. The 7-French sheaths were then exchanged over
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wires for new PTBD tubes, similar as before (10-French on the
     right side and 8-French on the left side). These internal and external tubes
     were kept for internal drainage and were sutured to the skin using 0 Prolene.
     They were also affixed to the skin with StatLock. Dressings were applied on
     both sides. The pigtails of the catheters are in the duodenum and their
     proximal side holes are in the intrahepatic bile ducts above the hepatic
     hilum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications occurred.
     
     MEDICATIONS: Total of 10 mL of lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia
     subcutaneously. Total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed were given in
     divided intravenous doses under continuous hemodynamic monitoring during the
     procedure. Levoquin was given intravenously before starting the procedure. The
     patient also received premedications on the floor before the procedure. Total
     of 130 mL of Optiray 320 (nonionic contrast).
     
     CONCLUSION: Bile duct dilatation with an 8 mm cutting balloon. Bilateral PTBD
     tubes were replaced, same as before (10-French on the right and 8-French on
     the left).

     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man with biliary stenosis status post liver
     transplant.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and 
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 318**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  MAC
     anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology team.  The patient's abdominal
     wall and two biliary drains were prepared in a sterile fashion.  0.035 Amplatz
     guidewires were advanced through the biliary tubes into the jejunum.  Tubes
     were removed over the wire and 7-French bright-tip sheaths were advanced into
     the biliary tree.  Pull-out cholangiograms from the right and left sides were
     obtained through the sheaths.  The right-sided cholangiogram showed free
     progression of contrast into the small bowel; however, the right hepatic duct
                                                                 (Over)

     proximal to joining the left hepatic duct was noted to be stenotic and
     presumably did not respond to previous dilation. The left-sided cholangiogram
     showed some areas of strictured left bile duct. Decision was then made to
     dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was performed
     with 6 and 8 mm balloons.  The stenosed area in the right common bile duct as
     well as on the left and at the biliary-enteric anastomosis were dilated with 6
     and 8 mm cutting balloons.  Post-dilation cholangiograms showed opening of the
     stenosed areas with easier progression of contrast medium into the small
     bowel.  A new 10-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced over the wire
     on the right side and an 8-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced on
     the left side under fluoroscopic guidance.  Pigtails were formed in the
     jejunum and catheters were secured to the skin with an 0 silk stitch.  Right
     tube was connected to a drainage bag and the left tube was capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Pull-out cholangiograms showing stenosed areas in the right and left bile
     ducts, main bile ducts and biliary-enteric anastomosis.

     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man with biliary stenosis status post liver
     transplant.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and 
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 318**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  MAC
     anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology team.  The patient's abdominal
     wall and two biliary drains were prepared in a sterile fashion.  0.035 Amplatz
     guidewires were advanced through the biliary tubes into the jejunum.  Tubes
     were removed over the wire and 7-French bright-tip sheaths were advanced into
     the biliary tree.  Pull-out cholangiograms from the right and left sides were
     obtained through the sheaths.  The right-sided cholangiogram showed free
     progression of contrast into the small bowel; however, the right hepatic duct
                                                                 (Over)

     proximal to joining the left hepatic duct was noted to be stenotic and
     presumably did not respond to previous dilation. The left-sided cholangiogram
     showed some areas of strictured left bile duct. Decision was then made to
     dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was performed
     with 6 and 8 mm balloons.  The stenosed area in the right common bile duct as
     well as on the left and at the biliary-enteric anastomosis were dilated with 6
     and 8 mm cutting balloons.  Post-dilation cholangiograms showed opening of the
     stenosed areas with easier progression of contrast medium into the small
     bowel.  A new 10-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced over the wire
     on the right side and an 8-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced on
     the left side under fluoroscopic guidance.  Pigtails were formed in the
     jejunum and catheters were secured to the skin with an 0 silk stitch.  Right
     tube was connected to a drainage bag and the left tube was capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Pull-out cholangiograms showing stenosed areas in the right and left bile
     ducts, main bile ducts and biliary-enteric anastomosis.

     HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man with biliary stenosis status post liver
     transplant.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and 
     Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 318**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.  
     
     CONSENT:  After receiving explanation of the benefits and risks of the
     procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  MAC
     anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiology team.  The patient's abdominal
     wall and two biliary drains were prepared in a sterile fashion.  0.035 Amplatz
     guidewires were advanced through the biliary tubes into the jejunum.  Tubes
     were removed over the wire and 7-French bright-tip sheaths were advanced into
     the biliary tree.  Pull-out cholangiograms from the right and left sides were
     obtained through the sheaths.  The right-sided cholangiogram showed free
     progression of contrast into the small bowel; however, the right hepatic duct
                                                                 (Over)

     proximal to joining the left hepatic duct was noted to be stenotic and
     presumably did not respond to previous dilation. The left-sided cholangiogram
     showed some areas of strictured left bile duct. Decision was then made to
     dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was performed
     with 6 and 8 mm balloons.  The stenosed area in the right common bile duct as
     well as on the left and at the biliary-enteric anastomosis were dilated with 6
     and 8 mm cutting balloons.  Post-dilation cholangiograms showed opening of the
     stenosed areas with easier progression of contrast medium into the small
     bowel.  A new 10-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced over the wire
     on the right side and an 8-French biliary drainage catheter was advanced on
     the left side under fluoroscopic guidance.  Pigtails were formed in the
     jejunum and catheters were secured to the skin with an 0 silk stitch.  Right
     tube was connected to a drainage bag and the left tube was capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Pull-out cholangiograms showing stenosed areas in the right and left bile
     ducts, main bile ducts and biliary-enteric anastomosis.
     2)  Successful dilation with an 8-mm cutting balloon of the stenosed areas.
     3)  Placement of a 10-French biliary drainage catheter on the right and 8-
     French catheter on the left.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post liver transplant, status post
     bilateral biliary drainage catheter placement, now present leakage around the
     catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1278**],
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the benefits and the risks were explained to the patient, a written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  Preprocedure timeout was obtained.  The patient's
     abdominal wall and preextsting catheters were prepped and wrapped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  15 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia. 0.035 Amplatz guidewires were advanced through bilateral  biliary
     tubes into the jejunum. Tubes were removed over the wire and 7-French sheaths
     were advanced into the biliary tree.  Cholangiogram was performed from the
     right and left side through the sheath, which demonstrates stenosis of the
     right hepatic duct peripherally and left hepatic duct centrally.  Decision was
     made to dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was
     performed with 8-mm cutting balloon on the right hepatic duct and 8-mm
     noncutting balloon on left and right hepatic biliary duct.  Post dilation
     cholangiograms demonstrates both ducts appear patent.  New 8-French biliary
     drainage catheters were advanced over the wire on both sides under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Pigtails were performed in the jejunum and the catheter
     was secured to the skin.  Both catheters were capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
                                                                 (Over)

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      59 year old man s/p liver transplant needs tube cholangiogram to check both
      tubes
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt s/p liver transplant please do tube cholangiogram through both catheters to
      assess leak, biliary dilation, strictures per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post liver transplant, status post
     bilateral biliary drainage catheter placement, now present leakage around the
     catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1278**],
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the benefits and the risks were explained to the patient, a written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  Preprocedure timeout was obtained.  The patient's
     abdominal wall and preextsting catheters were prepped and wrapped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  15 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia. 0.035 Amplatz guidewires were advanced through bilateral  biliary
     tubes into the jejunum. Tubes were removed over the wire and 7-French sheaths
     were advanced into the biliary tree.  Cholangiogram was performed from the
     right and left side through the sheath, which demonstrates stenosis of the
     right hepatic duct peripherally and left hepatic duct centrally.  Decision was
     made to dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was
     performed with 8-mm cutting balloon on the right hepatic duct and 8-mm
     noncutting balloon on left and right hepatic biliary duct.  Post dilation
     cholangiograms demonstrates both ducts appear patent.  New 8-French biliary
     drainage catheters were advanced over the wire on both sides under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Pigtails were performed in the jejunum and the catheter
     was secured to the skin.  Both catheters were capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post liver transplant, status post
     bilateral biliary drainage catheter placement, now present leakage around the
     catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1278**],
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the benefits and the risks were explained to the patient, a written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  Preprocedure timeout was obtained.  The patient's
     abdominal wall and preextsting catheters were prepped and wrapped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  15 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia. 0.035 Amplatz guidewires were advanced through bilateral  biliary
     tubes into the jejunum. Tubes were removed over the wire and 7-French sheaths
     were advanced into the biliary tree.  Cholangiogram was performed from the
     right and left side through the sheath, which demonstrates stenosis of the
     right hepatic duct peripherally and left hepatic duct centrally.  Decision was
     made to dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was
     performed with 8-mm cutting balloon on the right hepatic duct and 8-mm
     noncutting balloon on left and right hepatic biliary duct.  Post dilation
     cholangiograms demonstrates both ducts appear patent.  New 8-French biliary
     drainage catheters were advanced over the wire on both sides under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Pigtails were performed in the jejunum and the catheter
     was secured to the skin.  Both catheters were capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
                                                                 (Over)

     MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post liver transplant, status post
     bilateral biliary drainage catheter placement, now present leakage around the
     catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1278**],
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the benefits and the risks were explained to the patient, a written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  Preprocedure timeout was obtained.  The patient's
     abdominal wall and preextsting catheters were prepped and wrapped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  15 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia. 0.035 Amplatz guidewires were advanced through bilateral  biliary
     tubes into the jejunum. Tubes were removed over the wire and 7-French sheaths
     were advanced into the biliary tree.  Cholangiogram was performed from the
     right and left side through the sheath, which demonstrates stenosis of the
     right hepatic duct peripherally and left hepatic duct centrally.  Decision was
     made to dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was
     performed with 8-mm cutting balloon on the right hepatic duct and 8-mm
     noncutting balloon on left and right hepatic biliary duct.  Post dilation
     cholangiograms demonstrates both ducts appear patent.  New 8-French biliary
     drainage catheters were advanced over the wire on both sides under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Pigtails were performed in the jejunum and the catheter
     was secured to the skin.  Both catheters were capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.

      tubes
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      pt s/p liver transplant please do tube cholangiogram through both catheters to
      assess leak, biliary dilation, strictures per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     MEDICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old man status post liver transplant, status post
     bilateral biliary drainage catheter placement, now present leakage around the
     catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**] [**Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1278**],
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 319**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     After the benefits and the risks were explained to the patient, a written
     informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table.  Preprocedure timeout was obtained.  The patient's
     abdominal wall and preextsting catheters were prepped and wrapped in the
     standard sterile fashion.  15 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for local
     anesthesia. 0.035 Amplatz guidewires were advanced through bilateral  biliary
     tubes into the jejunum. Tubes were removed over the wire and 7-French sheaths
     were advanced into the biliary tree.  Cholangiogram was performed from the
     right and left side through the sheath, which demonstrates stenosis of the
     right hepatic duct peripherally and left hepatic duct centrally.  Decision was
     made to dilate the stenosed areas with cutting balloon plasty.  This was
     performed with 8-mm cutting balloon on the right hepatic duct and 8-mm
     noncutting balloon on left and right hepatic biliary duct.  Post dilation
     cholangiograms demonstrates both ducts appear patent.  New 8-French biliary
     drainage catheters were advanced over the wire on both sides under
     fluoroscopic guidance. Pigtails were performed in the jejunum and the catheter
     was secured to the skin.  Both catheters were capped.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.
                                                                 (Over)
