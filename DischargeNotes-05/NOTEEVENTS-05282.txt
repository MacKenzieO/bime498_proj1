PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for sacral decubitus Stage
IV ulcer since [**3436-2-2**], he is a paraplegic times nine
years which occurred after a thoracotomy procedure, bladder
rupture, recurrent urinary tract infections, diabetes
mellitus Type 2 with neuropathy, osteomyelitis and history of

congenital nystagmus, depression with suicidal ideations,
hypoaldosteronism, hypomania and questionable history of
gastrointestinal bleed.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diverting colostomy
in [**3436-10-2**], urostomy in [**3433**], sacral
debridement and multiple adhesions, left orchiectomy with
perineal debridement, inguinal debridement, thoracotomy and
attempted repair of kyphosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies the use of tobacco or
alcohol.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Haldol, Morphine and
Erythromycin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil 100 mg q.d., Primidone 12.5
q.h.s., Oxycontin 40 mg b.i.d., Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.,
Insulin NPH 25 units q. AM, 33 units q. PM, with a regular
insulin sliding scale, Kayciel 40 mg q.d., Prevacid 30 mg
q.d., Heparin subcutaneously b.i.d., Florinef 0.2 mg q.d.,
Ambien 10 mg q.h.s., iron sulfate, also Topamax, Trileptal
and Ativan prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 99.6,
blood pressure 96/56, heartrate 74, respirations 16, 97% on
room air.  General, the patient was lying on his side,
speaking very softly.  Cardiac examination, normal S1 and S2,
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  There
was chest pain reproducible on palpation.  Lung examination,
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen had diffuse
tenderness, normoactive bowel sounds.  Colostomy bag.  There
was brown stool and urostomy present.  Extremities, the
patient had contractures of both legs and there were necrotic
areas on multiple toes.  Extremities were warm with no edema.
Back, sacral decubitus ulcer about 10 cm in diameter with
vacuum dressing in place.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood count 11.4,
hematocrit 37.3, platelets 369, sodium 137, potassium 4.4,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 20, BUN 20, creatinine 0.7, glucose
240.  Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or congestion.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease - The patient was
afebrile with all of his admission blood cultures pending.
Two days after admission the patient spiked a temperature of
101.2 and developed an elevated white blood cell count.  At
this time it was unknown if the source of the fever was
urinary tract infection versus possible osteomyelitis in his
sacral region as he has had osteomyelitis in the past.  The
patient was empirically started on antibiotics at that time.
It was found that the patient had gram negative rods growing
in his urine, however, he has chronic colonization so it was
unknown if this was infection versus colonization.  A few
days later the patient developed decrease in his oxygen
saturation and chest x-ray revealed the right lower lobe and
right middle lobe pneumonia.  Over the course of the next
couple of days, the patient decompensated from the
respiratory standpoint and had to be sent to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.  He was cared for in the Intensive Care
Unit for one day during which time he did not have to be
intubated.  He then returned to the floor and continued to
clinically improve until the time of discharge.  In terms of
the possible sacral osteomyelitis, magnetic resonance was
done which showed some edema in the pelvic bones, not
definitive for osteomyelitis but incidentally found a right
femur fracture.  Orthopedics was consulted and the decision
was made for conservative management at that time.

2.  Diabetes mellitus - The patient was initially started on
regular insulin sliding scale.  His home NPH was held
initially and was reinstituted on [**8-10**] with good control
of his blood sugar.

3.  Pain - The patient was continued on his previous doses of
Oxycontin, Neurontin, Topamax, Trileptal and Oxycodone was
added prn.  The patient continued to complain of mild pain in
his feet throughout this hospital stay and Neurontin was
slowly increased up to a discharge dose of 900 mg t.i.d.

4.  Sacral decubitus ulcer - On admission the patient had a
vacuum dressing in place which repeatedly fell off during the
admission.  The Plastics Department was kind enough to
replace his dressing prn.

5.  Psychiatry - Although the patient's affect most of the
time was hypomanic with grandiose plans at times during his
hospital stay he became extremely depressed.  Psychiatry
consult was called.  They continued to see him on a daily
basis but there were no recommendations for change in
medications.

6.  Code status - The patient was initially
Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate on admission at the time
in which he decompensated and needed to be sent to the unit.
He reversed his code status to full code and then after he
recovered from his acute illness he is leaning now again
towards Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate but no final
decision has been made.  This is an issue which will be
discussed with his primary doctor at a later date.

Review Of Systems

Neuro:  Pt alert and oriented X3, able to partake in decision making and plan of care.  Side rails up X4.  Pt cooperative with all care.  Pt pain level remained constant at 9/10; pt medicated for pain w/ PO hydromorphone. Pt also has PRN order for Diladid IVP.

Cardiovascular:  Pt rhythm in sinus tach 90-100's, no ectopy noted. Hypotensive (low of 60's, symptomatic) for most of shift, this evening pt's SBP has returned to baseline 90's.  Pt bolused multiple times with NS to  replete volume status.  Pt recieved 5 L of NS and 1 unit of PRBC. CVP was 2 at 0700 and increased to 6 by 1000, and is maintained at 6.  H/H: 25.3/8.1  After extensive discussion w/ PT, PT's home case manager and HCP (by phone), pt decided to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8406**] [**Last Name (un) 8407**] status to include no pressors.  Pt has weak pedal pulses, and +3 edema in bilateral feet.   

Respiratory:  Pt is on a face mask at 100% and oxygen saturation is at 92%.  pt suctioned X2, scant, white, thick sputum obtained.  Pt is course throughout all lung fields, and recieved 2 respiratory treatments for sob and low O2 sats.  pt's respiratory rate is 20, and nonlabored.

Gastrointestinal:  Pt is Soft, nondistended, tender, has hypoactive bowel sounds, and had a sm bowel movement per ostomy.  Pt is maintained on TPN at 87.5 ml/hour, and is able to swallow fluids, and food by mouth.
