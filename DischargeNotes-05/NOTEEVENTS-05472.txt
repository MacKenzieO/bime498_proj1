History of Present Illness:
77 year old male with hx of CAD, CRI, HTN and afib, presents to 
teh [**Hospital1 83**] on [**3394-4-8**] for evaluation of GIB. Patient presented to 
[**Hospital3 865**] on [**3394-3-30**] with BRBPR and a HCT of 25.5. A 
colonoscopy perfromed there revealed blood and old clots 
throughout with no obvious source identified. The rectosigmoid 
was noted to look inflamed with ? of mild ischemia. Patient had 
an EGD that revealed esophagitis and gastritis. 4 U PRBC and 
transferred to the [**Hospital1 83**] for management. Patient was abmitted to 
the SICU. Here his abmission HCT was 38.3. Here bleeding scan 
negative for source of active bleeding, but study limited due to 
contrast in the abdomen. Patient also noted at that time to be 
hypotensive, and started on dopamine-changed to lepaphed and 
neosenephrine. Patient also received Vit K, 4U FFP. Patient's 
HCTs in the SICU as follows: 38.3 ([**4-8**]), 26.0 (txd 2 U PRBC), 
31.6, 27.9 , 34.6. Patient has been off pressors since [**4-9**]/ at 
0400, and has remained hemodynamically stable. Cards, GI and 
Renal consulted in SICU and following. Patient with Maroon stool 
in SICU, but no BRBPR or active bleeding. Patient was 
transferred out to the floor on [**3394-4-11**] and went into respiratory 
failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema from diastolic 
dysfunction. Patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU. 
Patient was exubated the following day after diuresis and

Colonoscopy: Polyps found in the transverse and distal colon; 
polypectomy not done given recent GI bleed.

Endoscopy: Linear erythema of mucosa was noted in the stomach 
body.  Findings consistent with gastritis

Right upper extremity ultrasound: FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name 264**]-scale and 
Doppler sonograms of the right internal jugular, subclavian, 
axillary, brachial, and left subclavian veins were performed. A 
small amount of non-occlusive fibrinous material is demonstrated 
within the right internal jugular vein. No thrombus is 
identified in the right subclavian or axillary veins. There are 
small hypoechoic subcutaneous collections demonstrated in the 
right upper arm consistent with hematomas. Note is made of a 
right cephalic to brachial AV fistula, which limits evaluation 
of the distal waveforms. Limited evaluation of the right 
brachial vein demonstrates no evidence for occlusive thrombus

Echocardiogram [**3394-4-9**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is 
moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.  There 
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.  LVEF 50-60%  

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
## GI bleed:  Workup at outside hospital negative.  Patient had 
colonscopy and endoscopy done while in hospital.  The 
colonoscopy showed polyps in the transverse and distal colon and 
the EGD was showed gastritis.  Patient was put on Protonix bid.  
The polyps that were found were not removed given the fact that 
the patient had recent GI bleed.  Patient will need a repeat 
colonoscopy in about 1 month to have polyps removed.  Patient 
also underwent pill endoscopy to find a possible source of 
bleeding in the small bowel, results will be forwarded to 
patient's primary care doctor for further follow up if needed.
.  
## Resp Failure - When patient was initially transferred to 
floor from surgery ICU he became hypoxic and needed to be 
intubated.  The most likely cause was flash pulmonary edema 
since patient was getting IVF.  In the MICU patient was started 
on hemodialysis and his respiratory status greatly improved.  He 
was extubated after 24 hours.  Serial chest xrays showed that 
the patient has bilateral pleural effusions which improved after 
dialysis.  Once patient was continued on HD his O2 requirements 
greatly decreased.   
.  
# Renal Failure: Most likely secondary to HTN and DM. Patient 
had tunnel cath placed and initiated on hemodialysis which he 
will now need permanantly.  Continued nephro caps.  Patient has 
been setup with outpatient HD and will continue to see his 
primary nephrologist outpatient.    
.  
## HTN: Patient's BP well controlled with Toprol XL and 
dialysis. Added lisinopril 2.5mg to patient's regimine.  
.  
## Afib: Patient remained rate controlled throughout hospital 
course. Anti-coagulation for Afib was held since patient with 
active GI bleed in hospital.  Continued patient on BBlocker.
  
## CHF - Patient intially started on Coreg which was later 
changed to Toprol XL 50mg. Patient with LVEF of 55%-60%. He most 
likely has diastolic dysfunction.  Patient should avoid access 
salt/volume administration. Continue dialysis to help remove 
access fluid. Kept patient fluid restricted to 1500ml/day  
.  
## Leukocytosis/UTI - While in the ICU patient with elevated WBC 
and hypothermic.  Cultures were sent which came back positive 
for Proteus species in urine, sputum, and femoral line tip.  
Patient was started on Ceftaz while in hospital, should complete 
14 day course at rehab.
.  
## RUE fistula - Patient right upper extremity continued to be 
swollen.  A RUE U/S was done which was negative for clot. A 
venogram was performed since patient had fistula and central 
cath on right side to assess if patient has any stenosis.  
Venogram did show stenosis and PTA was performed by IR which 
improved swelling.  HOwever IR did state that graft may have to 
be revised.  Patient should follow up with his outpatient 
nephrologist and surgeon about possible revision of graft.
.  
## DM-2: ISS and QID FS. Blood sugars have been on the low to 
normal while in hospital.  Patient blood sugars should be 
monitored carefully and if blood sugars remain low may not 
require insulin.  
.  
## Psych - Patient kept on outpatient regimine of risperidol 
0.25mg bid, and prn ativan.

     MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM.
     
     INDICATION:  Low GI bleeding.
     
     Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
     patient's wife over the phone and informed consent was obtained.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pre-procedure fluoroscopy of the pelvis and abdomen demonstrated
     large amount of contrast material within the colon, which makes mesenteric
     angiography study markedly limited for subtle extravasation.
     
     Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right common femoral artery
     was punctured and a 5-French sheath was introduced over a guidewire using
     Seldinger technique.  A 5-French Glide C2 catheter was introduced over the
     wire through the sheath and its tip engaged into the origin of the superior
     mesenteric artery.  Several injections were performed with filming in
     different projections.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French Sos
     Omni catheter and its tip engaged into the origin of the inferior mesenteric
     artery.  Several injections were done for arteriography of the inferior
     mesenteric artery in different projections.  The catheter and the sheath were
     then removed from the femoral artery and hemostasis was achieved.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     CONTRAST MATERIAL:  150 cc of Visipaque was used.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to presence of large amount of
     contrast material in the colon.  No obvious areas of extravasation are seen
     within the superior and inferior mesenteric arterial territories.  Note is of
     made of replaced hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery.

     patient's wife over the phone and informed consent was obtained.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pre-procedure fluoroscopy of the pelvis and abdomen demonstrated
     large amount of contrast material within the colon, which makes mesenteric
     angiography study markedly limited for subtle extravasation.
     
     Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right common femoral artery
     was punctured and a 5-French sheath was introduced over a guidewire using
     Seldinger technique.  A 5-French Glide C2 catheter was introduced over the
     wire through the sheath and its tip engaged into the origin of the superior
     mesenteric artery.  Several injections were performed with filming in
     different projections.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French Sos
     Omni catheter and its tip engaged into the origin of the inferior mesenteric
     artery.  Several injections were done for arteriography of the inferior
     mesenteric artery in different projections.  The catheter and the sheath were
     then removed from the femoral artery and hemostasis was achieved.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     CONTRAST MATERIAL:  150 cc of Visipaque was used.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to presence of large amount of
     contrast material in the colon.  No obvious areas of extravasation are seen
     within the superior and inferior mesenteric arterial territories.  Note is of
     made of replaced hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please eval for GI bleed

     MESENTERIC ANGIOGRAM.
     
     INDICATION:  Low GI bleeding.
     
     Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
     patient's wife over the phone and informed consent was obtained.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was
     present for the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Pre-procedure fluoroscopy of the pelvis and abdomen demonstrated
     large amount of contrast material within the colon, which makes mesenteric
     angiography study markedly limited for subtle extravasation.
     
     Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right common femoral artery
     was punctured and a 5-French sheath was introduced over a guidewire using
     Seldinger technique.  A 5-French Glide C2 catheter was introduced over the
     wire through the sheath and its tip engaged into the origin of the superior
     mesenteric artery.  Several injections were performed with filming in
     different projections.  The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French Sos
     Omni catheter and its tip engaged into the origin of the inferior mesenteric
     artery.  Several injections were done for arteriography of the inferior
     mesenteric artery in different projections.  The catheter and the sheath were
     then removed from the femoral artery and hemostasis was achieved.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
     complications.
     
     CONTRAST MATERIAL:  150 cc of Visipaque was used.
     
     FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to presence of large amount of
     contrast material in the colon.  No obvious areas of extravasation are seen
     within the superior and inferior mesenteric arterial territories.  Note is of
     made of replaced hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery.

     HISTORY: 77-year-old man with chronic renal failure, multiple medical
     problems, needs tunneled line for hemodialysis.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 293**] [**Doctor Last Name 294**] d'Othee, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) 295**] (attending radiologist) present
     and supervising the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Consent was obtained from the patient's wife and the
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The right neck and upper
     chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle after local
     administration of 1% lidocaine. A 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the
     needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was
     exchanged for a 4.5-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator.
     
     Attention was then turned to creation of the tunnel. 1% lidocaine was
     administered in the designated tunnel tract. A skin incision was made with a
     #11 blade scalpel. The hemodialysis catheter (24 cm, measuring 19 cm tip to
     cuff) was connected to a tunneling device, and advanced through the tunnel,
     and out adjacent to the venous insertion site. The tunneling device was
     removed.
     
     The tract was sequentially dilated with 8, 10, 12 and 14-French dilators. A
     14-French peel-away sheath with inner dilator was advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The inner dilator, and guidewire were removed. The catheter was
     advanced through the peel-away sheath through the superior vena cava. The
     peel-away sheath was removed. Final fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the
     tip of the catheter to be in the high right atrium. The catheter was flushed,
     capped, and hep-locked, and secured to the skin using 0- silk sutures. The
     venous insertion site was closed with Dermabond. The catheter was covered with
     dry sterile dressing and Op-Site.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of right internal jugular 14-French, 19 cm
     tip to cuff, tunneled hemodialysis catheter with tip in the high right atrium,
     ready for use.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 77-year-old man with chronic renal failure, multiple medical
     problems, needs tunneled line for hemodialysis.
     
     PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 862**] [**Name (STitle) 863**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 293**] [**Doctor Last Name 294**] d'Othee, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) 295**] (attending radiologist) present
     and supervising the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Consent was obtained from the patient's wife and the
     patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The right neck and upper
     chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. The right internal
     jugular vein was accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle after local
     administration of 1% lidocaine. A 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the
     needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was
     exchanged for a 4.5-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator.
     
     Attention was then turned to creation of the tunnel. 1% lidocaine was
     administered in the designated tunnel tract. A skin incision was made with a
     #11 blade scalpel. The hemodialysis catheter (24 cm, measuring 19 cm tip to
     cuff) was connected to a tunneling device, and advanced through the tunnel,
     and out adjacent to the venous insertion site. The tunneling device was
     removed.
     
     The tract was sequentially dilated with 8, 10, 12 and 14-French dilators. A
     14-French peel-away sheath with inner dilator was advanced under fluoroscopic
     guidance. The inner dilator, and guidewire were removed. The catheter was
     advanced through the peel-away sheath through the superior vena cava. The
     peel-away sheath was removed. Final fluoroscopic spot film demonstrates the
     tip of the catheter to be in the high right atrium. The catheter was flushed,
     capped, and hep-locked, and secured to the skin using 0- silk sutures. The
     venous insertion site was closed with Dermabond. The catheter was covered with
     dry sterile dressing and Op-Site.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of right internal jugular 14-French, 19 cm
     tip to cuff, tunneled hemodialysis catheter with tip in the high right atrium,
     ready for use.

Pt. admitted to MICU service to MICU B after short (5 hour) stay on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5 from 2:30a-7:30a.  Previously, pt. in TSICU for LGIB.  Please see nursing note from [**4-9**] for admission info and PMH.  Reportedly, pt. was a medical pt. on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5 who transfered from TSICU d/t emergent trauma bed needed- and pt. was deemed stable.  Pt. reportedly arrived to [**Wardname **] with increasing O2 requirements, poor lung exam (crackles) and lethargy (also hypernatremic).  Pt. received 60mg of lasix prior to departure from TSICU with unclear amount of output.  Pt. later required 100% NRB for desaturations.  At approx. 6am, during routine am care, pt. experienced witnessed decreased responsiveness leading to unresponsiveness and sat's of 60%.  MDs aware and ordered an add'l 40mg of lasix.  Significantly- of note, pt. receiving IVF (bicarb for acidosis). Pt. was intubated on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5 for sat's 80% on 100% and change in MS.  Pt. transfered to MICU at 7:30am for further w/u of resp. fx and fluid status management.  Of note, pt. was scheduled for HD today and colonscopy for which he was prepped.  

Pt. arrived to MICU hypothermic to 92.9 PO (would not register PR), in Slow AF with BP >130's.  AM labs revealing of high WBC.  Throughout the am, pt. was cultured.  HD put on hold as well as colonoscopy in the setting of high troponin (elevated CREAT as well).  Lasix given X 1 and to be repeated.  ABX to be started d/t ""dirty"" urine and sputm.  

Review of Systems-

Neuro-  Pt. observed making purposeful movements towards ETT, moving all extremeties requiring use of Propofol at 10mcg/kg/min.  Pupils not examined b/c pt. not cooperating with exam.  Pt. has signficant PMH of Bipolar disorder and lives in [**Location **].  Written in notes that pt. is usually alert and confused about time.  

Resp-  Pt. remains intubated on A/C 600X16 30% (reduced from 100%)- on 60% ABG 7.35/34/157/20.  LS- coarse/crackles/diminshed.  CXR significant for interstitial markings, infiltrate in LUL and perhilar pattern, pleural effusions.  Sputum sent and appears contaminated- will start triple abx for now.  Sx'ing pink frothy sputum, occ thick tan.  Sat's maintained >95%.  Probable cause of resp. fx is CHF w/ significant diastolic dysfunction from AS and fluid overloaded state.  Will consider extubation tom'row.

CV-  HR low of 48-60's AFIB with occ PVC.  BP 90's-120 systolic via NBP.  CVP 12 this afternoon after lasix.  Labs repeated and K found to be low- repleted with 80meQ infusing now.  To receive another 200mg of Lasix.  Troponin high in the setting of elevated creat and flat CK, will continue r/o with 1800 labs.  Skin compromised- on coccyx and at right new fistula sight- poor bruit, poor color and very edemedous extremeties +4.  Weak pulses.  Right femoral line changed to left subclavian triple lumen- line cx'd.  Pt. with thromobocytopenia so oozing at new line site.  

GI/GU-  No evidence of LGIB (HCT stable)- stool golden to clear.  NGT clamped.  NPO for now, possible scope tom'row if stable and r/o MI.  Receivi

        77 year old man with CHF, respiratory failure .                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for PNA or CHF

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  CHF and respiratory failure, question edema or pneumonia.
     
     An upright AP chest radiograph shows no change in positioning of a left
     subclavian central venous catheter, low right IJ tunneled catheter and
     nasogastric tube.  The endotracheal tube is not seen in the view of the film
     and has apparently been removed.  Again noted is large right pleural effusion
     with a different appearance today on this upright view.  The retrocardiac area
     of the left base is obscured, otherwise, the left lung and the visible
     portions of the right lung appear clear.  Central pulmonary, vascular
     congestion is largely decreased.  Note is made of a left ventricular
     configuration to the heart and significant calcified atherosclerotic plaque in
     the thoracic aorta. Note that in addition to the very large right pleural
     effusion, a smaller left pleural effusion appears present as well and could be
     confirmed on the lateral view.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Large right pleural effusion and probable small left pleural
     effusion.  A left for retrocardiac consolidation, which may represent
     atelectasis or pneumonia.  When patient is able, lateral view in addition to
     the AP view PA view would be helpful.

     There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler sonograms of the right internal jugular,
     subclavian, axillary, brachial, and left subclavian veins were performed.  A
     small amount of non-occlusive fibrinous material is demonstrated within the
     right internal jugular vein.  No thrombus is identified in the right
     subclavian or axillary veins.  There are small hypoechoic subcutaneous
     collections demonstrated in the right upper arm consistent with hematomas.
     Note is made of a right cephalic to brachial AV fistula, which limits
     evaluation of the distal waveforms.  Limited evaluation of the right brachial
     vein demonstrates no evidence for occlusive thrombus.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Nonocclusive fibrinous material in the right internal jugular vein, most
     consistent with sequela of prior line.
     
     2.  No evidence of thrombus in the subclavian or axillary veins with no gross
     evidence of thrombus in the limited evaluation of the right brachial vein.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      77 year old man with RUE fistula placed in [**3394-3-24**] and has tunnel cath on right 
      side.  Patient with RUE swelling 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess for stenosis or central problem                                          
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  77-year-old male with right upper extremity fistula, now
     with right upper extremity edema.  Assess for stenosis.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1085**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was present and supervising.  Written informed
     consent was obtained from the patient's wife.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed to ensure patient identity and appropriateness of the procedure. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  The right upper arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately 3 cc of 1%
     lidocaine were used for local anesthesia.  Access was achieved with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced with ease into the
     superior vena cava, and the needle was exchanged for a 4-French sheath.
     Initial fistulogram demonstrates a two tight, irregular stenoses, one at the
     anastomosis and the second at the proximal fistula.  It was felt to be
     unlikely that either of these lesions would respond to angioplasty.  An
     additional area of stenosis was visualized in the fistula at the level of the
     mid humerus.  A tight, long stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein was
     identified as well.
     
     Based on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient would
     benefit from and was a good candidate for angioplasty.  The 4- French sheath
     was then exchanged for a 6- French bright tip sheath. The more distal mid-
     humerus fistula stenosis was dilated with 6 and then 8 mm balloons, with
     immediate angiographic results. The area of stenosis of the right
     brachiocephalic vein was dilated with both 8 and 10 mm balloons, with minimal
     response identified.
     
     The patient was transferred to the recovery area, where the sheath was
                                                                 (Over)

     removed. Continuous pressure was maintained until hemostasis was achieved.  No
     immediate post- procedure complications were noted.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Conscious sedation was provided by members of nursing staff
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  A total of 100 cc of Optiray
     nonionic contrast material at 60% concentration were administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Two tight, irregular areas of stenoses at the fistula anastomosis and
     proximal fistula. It is unlikely that either of these areas will respond well
     to angioplasty. These most likely require surgical revision.
     2)  Stenosis in the fistula at the level of the mid humerus dilated with 6 and
     8 mm balloons with good, immediate angiographic results.
     3)  Tight, long stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein, which did not
     respond well to 8 and 10 mm balloons. Cutting balloon or stenting was not used
     due to indwelling dialysis catheter in place on the same side. If the decision
     is made to surgically revise the arterial anastomosis and save the graft, this
     area of stenosis will likely require a stent after the catheter
     removal/repositioning.

      77 year old man with RUE fistula placed in [**3394-3-24**] and has tunnel cath on right 
      side.  Patient with RUE swelling 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      assess for stenosis or central problem

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  77-year-old male with right upper extremity fistula, now
     with right upper extremity edema.  Assess for stenosis.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1085**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was present and supervising.  Written informed
     consent was obtained from the patient's wife.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed to ensure patient identity and appropriateness of the procedure. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  The right upper arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately 3 cc of 1%
     lidocaine were used for local anesthesia.  Access was achieved with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced with ease into the
     superior vena cava, and the needle was exchanged for a 4-French sheath.
     Initial fistulogram demonstrates a two tight, irregular stenoses, one at the
     anastomosis and the second at the proximal fistula.  It was felt to be
     unlikely that either of these lesions would respond to angioplasty.  An
     additional area of stenosis was visualized in the fistula at the level of the
     mid humerus.  A tight, long stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein was
     identified as well.
     
     Based on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient would
     benefit from and was a good candidate for angioplasty.  The 4- French sheath
     was then exchanged for a 6- French bright tip sheath. The more distal mid-
     humerus fistula stenosis was dilated with 6 and then 8 mm balloons, with
     immediate angiographic results. The area of stenosis of the right
     brachiocephalic vein was dilated with both 8 and 10 mm balloons, with minimal
     response identified.
     
     The patient was transferred to the recovery area, where the sheath was
                                                                 (Over)

     removed. Continuous pressure was maintained until hemostasis was achieved.  No
     immediate post- procedure complications were noted.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Conscious sedation was provided by members of nursing staff
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  A total of 100 cc of Optiray
     nonionic contrast material at 60% concentration were administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Two tight, irregular areas of stenoses at the fistula anastomosis and
     proximal fistula. It is unlikely that either of these areas will respond well
     to angioplasty. These most likely require surgical revision.
     2)  Stenosis in the fistula at the level of the mid humerus dilated with 6 and
     8 mm balloons with good, immediate angiographic results.
     3)  Tight, long stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein, which did not
     respond well to 8 and 10 mm balloons. Cutting balloon or stenting was not used
     due to indwelling dialysis catheter in place on the same side. If the decision
     is made to surgically revise the arterial anastomosis and save the graft, this
     area of stenosis will likely require a stent after the catheter
     removal/repositioning.

     8 mm balloons with good, immediate angiographic results.
     3)  Tight, long stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein, which did not
     respond well to 8 and 10 mm balloons. Cutting balloon or stenting was not used
     due to indwelling dialysis catheter in place on the same side. If the decision
     is made to surgically revise the arterial anastomosis and save the graft, this
     area of stenosis will likely require a stent after the catheter
     removal/repositioning.

      77 year old man with RUE fistula placed in [**3394-3-24**] and has tunnel cath on right 
      side.  Patient with RUE swelling 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  77-year-old male with right upper extremity fistula, now
     with right upper extremity edema.  Assess for stenosis.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1085**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], staff radiologist, was present and supervising.  Written informed
     consent was obtained from the patient's wife.  A preprocedure timeout was
     performed to ensure patient identity and appropriateness of the procedure. The
     patient was placed supine on the angiography table.  The right upper arm was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Approximately 3 cc of 1%
     lidocaine were used for local anesthesia.  Access was achieved with a 21-gauge
     micropuncture needle.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced with ease into the
     superior vena cava, and the needle was exchanged for a 4-French sheath.
     Initial fistulogram demonstrates a two tight, irregular stenoses, one at the
     anastomosis and the second at the proximal fistula.  It was felt to be
     unlikely that either of these lesions would respond to angioplasty.  An
     additional area of stenosis was visualized in the fistula at the level of the
     mid humerus.  A tight, long stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein was
     identified as well.
     
     Based on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient would
     benefit from and was a good candidate for angioplasty.  The 4- French sheath
     was then exchanged for a 6- French bright tip sheath. The more distal mid-
     humerus fistula stenosis was dilated with 6 and then 8 mm balloons, with
     immediate angiographic results. The area of stenosis of the right
     brachiocephalic vein was dilated with both 8 and 10 mm balloons, with minimal
     response identified.
     
     The patient was transferred to the recovery area, where the sheath was
                                                                 (Over)

     immediate post- procedure complications were noted.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Conscious sedation was provided by members of nursing staff
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  A total of 100 cc of Optiray
     nonionic contrast material at 60% concentration were administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Two tight, irregular areas of stenoses at the fistula anastomosis and
     proximal fistula. It is unlikely that either of these areas will respond well
     to angioplasty. These most likely require surgical revision.

     unlikely that either of these lesions would respond to angioplasty.  An
     additional area of stenosis was visualized in the fistula at the level of the
     mid humerus.  A tight, long stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein was
     identified as well.
     
     Based on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient would
     benefit from and was a good candidate for angioplasty.  The 4- French sheath
     was then exchanged for a 6- French bright tip sheath. The more distal mid-
     humerus fistula stenosis was dilated with 6 and then 8 mm balloons, with
     immediate angiographic results. The area of stenosis of the right
     brachiocephalic vein was dilated with both 8 and 10 mm balloons, with minimal
     response identified.
     
     The patient was transferred to the recovery area, where the sheath was
                                                                 (Over)

     removed. Continuous pressure was maintained until hemostasis was achieved.  No
     immediate post- procedure complications were noted.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  Conscious sedation was provided by members of nursing staff
     under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.  A total of 100 cc of Optiray
     nonionic contrast material at 60% concentration were administered.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Two tight, irregular areas of stenoses at the fistula anastomosis and
     proximal fistula. It is unlikely that either of these areas will respond well
     to angioplasty. These most likely require surgical revision.
     2)  Stenosis in the fistula at the level of the mid humerus dilated with 6 and
     8 mm balloons with good, immediate angiographic results.
     3)  Tight, long stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein, which did not
     respond well to 8 and 10 mm balloons. Cutting balloon or stenting was not used
     due to indwelling dialysis catheter in place on the same side. If the decision
     is made to surgically revise the arterial anastomosis and save the graft, this
     area of stenosis will likely require a stent after the catheter
     removal/repositioning.
