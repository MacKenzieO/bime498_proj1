     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      72 year old man with chronic prod cough, mild sob                               
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ?mass RUL on outside CXR

     CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
     
     INDICATION:  Chronic productive cough, mild shortness of breath, wheezing, but
     no fever.  Evaluate for possible mass seen on [**8-14**] films from [**Location (un) **]
     Trauma Center.
     
     FINDINGS:  The heart size is within normal limits.  No typical configurational
     abnormality is seen.  Thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated. 
     There is a right-sided mediastinal density measuring approximately 4 cm in
     width and overlying the right hilar vasculature.  Some radiating linear
     densities extend into the periphery of the lung field and on the lateral view,
     the mass density impinges into the posterior wall of the trachea and the right
     main bronchus.  There is reduced volume of the right hemithorax in comparison
     with the left side.  The left lung is clear from infiltrates and no congestive
     pattern is seen.  On the left base, a well-demarcated less than 1-cm diameter
     granuloma is identified.
     
     Available for comparison is a preceding portable AP view chest examination
     with the patient in semi-upright position.  The patient was at that time
     postoperative status to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  A pneumothorax was
     ruled out following the placement of a right-sided internal jugular sheath
     placement but widening of the superior mediastinum was commented upon in the
     corresponding report.  Mediastinal widening was also noted on the portable
     examination of [**2780-3-17**], at which time the patient was in CHF and
     intubated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Development of mediastinal mass overlying the right hilar area
     and extending into pulmonary tissue.  Chest CT for more detail evaluation of
     the mass is recommended.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      mass RUL

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Recent pneumonia, now with persistent cough and shortness of
     breath.  Suggestion of right upper lobe mass on plain film.
     
     No prior CTs are available for comparison purposes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without the use of
     intravenous contrast material.  Images are presented for display in the axial
     plane in 5- and 1.25-mm thickness.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  A right hilar soft tissue mass measuring
     8.2 x 9.3 x 7.5 cm is relatively homogeneous soft tissue density with several
     small areas of slightly lower attenuation.  The mass severely compresses the
     entire right main stem bronchus to a residual lumen of approximately 2 mm and
     produces irregularity of the wall suggesting ivasion. The right upper and
     lower lobe bronchi are encased by the tumor mass.  The hilar mass compresses
     the SVC at the level of the aortic arch, invading the mediastinum and crossing
     the midline in the proximity of the carina.  It is in contiguity with the
     right main pulmonary artery up to approximately 1 cm from the bifurcation of
     the main pulmonary artery.  The aggregate of enlarged subcarinal and upper
     paraesophageal lymph nodes measures  6cm in short axis diameter (series 2,
     image 34). In addition, there are several calcified paraesophageal lymph
     nodes and a calcified granuloma inferior to the left pulmonary vein. There is
     no pericardial effusion.  The vocal cords are symmetric.  The remainder of the
     lungs are grossly clear.  No pleural effusions or consolidations are seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
     
     The sections through the upper abdomen are pertinent for gallbladder wall
     calcification suggesting a porcelain gallbladder.  This may be further
     investigated with a contrast-enhanced CT to exclude gallbladder carcinoma.
     There are calcifications of the aorta and the celiac axis.  There are several
     calcified granulomas in the spleen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  8.2 x 9.3 x 7.5 cm right hilar soft tissue mass, narrowing and possibly
     invading the right main stem bronchus, right pulmonary artery, and SVC,
     invading the mediastinum and crossing the midline at the level of the carina.
     2.  Lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal and paraesophageal lymph node stations.
     3.  Mass is in contiguity with the right pulmonary artery, possible invasion
     cannot be assessed on this non-contrast study.
     4.  Porcelain gallbladder.  A contrast-enhanced CT study may be indicated for
     further assessment to exclude gallbladder carcinoma.
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study performed on [**2780-8-22**].
     
     There is again seen a large mass seen in the right suprahilar region. There
     has been increase in consolidation within the right upper lobe, which likely
     represents a component of postobstructive pneumonitis from the mass.  This is
     increased since the previous study.  There is also developing opacity in the
     right base.  The opacity seen at the left base previously has improved
     slightly.  There is cardiomegaly.

     INDICATION:  Newly diagnosed lung cancer.  Evaluate extent of involvement.
     Evaluate for metastases.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed, with images
     obtained both before and after administration of IV contrast.  Coronally and
     sagittally reformatted images were also obtained as well as MINIP post-
     processing imagings.  A total of 120 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast was given
     for this examination.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Multiple
     mediastinal lymph nodes are present, measuring up to approximately 1.5 cm in
     the subcarinal space.  Small subcentimeter lymph nodes at the left hilum are
     present.
     
     There is a dominant right hilar mass, which measures up to 8.8 cm AP x 9.8 cm
     TV x 8.5 cm SI in size.  The mass involves predominantly the right upper lobe,
     abutting and distorting the major fissure. This mass encases the distal
     trachea and carina, causing obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus, and
     causing marked narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus. The mass abuts the
     distal esophagus with obliteration of the separating fat plane. It encases the
     SVC, encases and severely narrows the right upper lobe pulmonary artery trunk,
     and encases the right middle lobe pulmonary vein.  The mass also abuts the
     right lower lobe main pulmonary artery trunk with obliteration of the fat
     plane.
     
     Enlarged right hilar lymph nodes are seen, measuring up to 1.3 cm in size.
     
     Examination of lung windows shows several small satellite lesions in the right
     upper lobe adjacent to the dominant mass.  In addition, there is airspace
     opacity seen in the dependent portion of the left lower lobe superior segment,
     which may represent sequelae from aspiration, although metastatic spread
     cannot be excluded.  A tracheal stent is present.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Two hypodense and
     hypoenhancing lesions are seen in segment V/VI of the liver (series 6, images

     porcelain gallbladder.  The spleen, pancreas, right adrenal gland, and kidneys
     appear unremarkable aside from multiple tiny hypodense foci within the
     kidneys, possibly small renal cysts.  The left adrenal gland appears full, and
     moreso when compared to the examination of [**2780-2-19**].  Small retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes are also present, not meeting size criteria for pathologic
     enlargement.  The patient is status post aortic aneurysm repair; the excluded
     aorta has decreased in size. Retrocrural lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in
     short axis. There is no mesenteric adenopathy or free fluid.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Diffuse diverticulosis is present.  The
     bladder is quite distended.  The prostate is enlarged.  There is no pelvic
     adenopathy or free fluid.  Vascular calcifications of the iliac and femoral
     vessels are present.
     
     Examination of osseous structures does not show lytic or sclerotic lesions
     suspicious for malignancy.  Degenerative changes are seen at both sacroiliac
     joints and at the lumbar spine.  In addition, marked degenerative changes are
     seen at the left shoulder.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large right hilar mass, predominantly within the right upper lobe and
     abutting the major fissure.
     2.  Patchy airspace opacity seen predominantly in the left lower lobe superior
     segment.  While this may represent aspiration, metastasis cannot be excluded.
     3.  Two hypoenhancing lesions within the liver, both suspicious for metastatic
     disease.
     4.  Left adrenal nodule has increased slightly in size since the examination
     of [**2780-2-19**], concering for malignancy.
     5.  Porcelain gallbladder.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Newly diagnosed lung cancer.  Evaluate extent of involvement.
     Evaluate for metastases.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed, with images
     obtained both before and after administration of IV contrast.  Coronally and
     sagittally reformatted images were also obtained as well as MINIP post-
     processing imagings.  A total of 120 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast was given
     for this examination.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Multiple
     mediastinal lymph nodes are present, measuring up to approximately 1.5 cm in
     the subcarinal space.  Small subcentimeter lymph nodes at the left hilum are
     present.
     
     There is a dominant right hilar mass, which measures up to 8.8 cm AP x 9.8 cm
     TV x 8.5 cm SI in size.  The mass involves predominantly the right upper lobe,
     abutting and distorting the major fissure. This mass encases the distal
     trachea and carina, causing obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus, and
     causing marked narrowing of the right middle lobe bronchus. The mass abuts the
     distal esophagus with obliteration of the separating fat plane. It encases the
     SVC, encases and severely narrows the right upper lobe pulmonary artery trunk,
     and encases the right middle lobe pulmonary vein.  The mass also abuts the
     right lower lobe main pulmonary artery trunk with obliteration of the fat
     plane.
     
     Enlarged right hilar lymph nodes are seen, measuring up to 1.3 cm in size.
     
     Examination of lung windows shows several small satellite lesions in the right
     upper lobe adjacent to the dominant mass.  In addition, there is airspace
     opacity seen in the dependent portion of the left lower lobe superior segment,
     which may represent sequelae from aspiration, although metastatic spread
     cannot be excluded.  A tracheal stent is present.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Two hypodense and
     hypoenhancing lesions are seen in segment V/VI of the liver (series 6, images
                                                                 (Over)

ICU callout, orginally admitted with fevers, chills, neutropenia 
s/p chemo in afib with RVR. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3913**] is a 74 year-old male with PAF off anticoagulation, 
and recently diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer 
status post Y stent tracheal placement for obstruction, status 
post Carboplatin/Etoposide chemotherapy on [**2780-8-26**], who 
presented from the ED with febrile neutropenia and AF with RVR. 
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 83**] [**2780-8-21**] -> [**2780-8-29**] to 
expedite work-up of his newly diagnosed lung mass, as above 
confirmed as extensive stage SCLC. During this admission, he 
underwent placement of a Y tracheal stent, and received 
chemotherapy. He was also treated with Unasyn for presumed 
post-obstructive pneumonia. His Coumadin was discontinued after 
finding encroachment of his mass on his pulmonary artery. He was 
in NSR at the time of discharge.  
*  
He now presented with a 1-week history of progressive cough, and 
increased sputum production, which he describes as whitish. In 
the ICU, the patient also complained of moderately severe 
""throat pain"", which he has had for about a month, worsening, 
with associated hoarseness as well as odynophagia with both 
solids and liquids. No clear dysphagia. No hemoptysis. He 
reports some RS pain with coughing, no other chest pain. No 
increase in SOB. No lower extremity swelling. He denies 
abdominal pain, no rectal pain, no GU complaints. + Chills at 
home. Tmax at home 100.5, which prompted his daughter to bring 
him to the ED.  
*  
In the ICU, antibiotics were continued (vanc, cefepime), and ENT 
evaluation was requested for hoarseness, odynophagia. The 
patient's afib was controlled with IV diltiazem pushes and 
metoprolol PO. The patient remained hemodynamically stable.

epithelial cells.  
.  
Blood cultures:  
[**9-8**]: 1/4 bottles Strep bovis pan sensitive, [**9-9**] and [**9-11**] 
negative to date  
.  
Imaging:  
Swallowing study: IMPRESSION: 1) No penetration or aspiration.  
CXR: IMPRESSION: Decreased size of the right hilar mass since 
the prior study. Improved aeration of the right lung. No 
infiltrate.  
.  
CT Chest: IMPRESSION:  
1. No pulmonary embolism.  
2. Decrease in size of large dominant right hilar mass.  
3. Tracheobronchial stent in unchanged position. Although the 
right hilar mass narrows the right upper and middle lobe bronchi 
they remain patent.  
4. New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 64**] opacity of the peripheral right upper and 
middle lobes is nonspecific but may be infectious, inflammatory, 
or possibly represent lymphangitic spread of tumor.  
5. New small areas of posterobasilar consolidation at both lung 
bases may be due to atelectasis but could represent infection.  
.  
ECHO [**2780-9-10**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function 
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is 
normal. Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets 
are moderately thickened. There  
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2780-5-2**], the 
focal thickening of the aortic leaflets is slightly more 
pronounced, but no aortic regurgitation is identified.  
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, 
a TEE may be better able to define the aortic valve morphology 
and to evaluate for possible vegetations.  
.  
Colonoscopy [**2780-9-16**]:Pt with multiple polyps that were removed 
and sent for pathology. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 74 year-old male with extensive stage SCLC 
with tracheal obstruction status post tracheal stent, status 
post first cycle of chemotherapy [**2780-8-26**], with febrile 
neutropenia, AF with RVR now improved.  
*  
1. Strep bovis baceremia with Hx of Febrile neutropenia: On 
admission patient was found to have febrile neutropenia.  As 
such, the patient was pancultured and found to have 1/4 bottles 
positive for Strep bovis. Given previous history thickened 
aortic valve and aortic valve vegetation, the patient was 
diagnosed with presumed bacterial endocarditis.  As recommended 
by infectious disease, he will be treated with IV penicillin for 
4 weeks.  Additionally, patient received colonoscopy given 
suspicious nature of strep bovis bacteremia for colonic lesions. 
 Pathology is pending. PICC was placed for long term Abx. The 
patient will likely need lifelong S Bovis suppression per ID (as 
pt has aortic graft). Therefore, the patient will follow up with 
ID ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) after discharge.  Neutropenia did resolve as 
patient had gotten neulasta.
- Penicillin 3 mill U IV Q4 x 4 weeks (Finishes [**10-8**])  
- VNA for IV Abx  
- F/U per ID  
*  
2. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 64**] opacity CT findings: CT chest showed findings 
that could represent fungal or mycobacterial.  However, patient 
had multiple induced sputum samples as well as fungal blood 
tests that were all negative.  Therefore, the patient was take 
off respiratory precautions. Therefore, the abnormal findings 
likely represent progression of lung cancer.
.  
3. Odynophagia/cough:  Concomitant hoarseness could be secondary 
to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement of neoplasm versus 
related to odynophagia. Improved with symptomatic treatment and 
decreased coughing as odynophagia is likely due to persistent 
coughing that is secondary to lung cancer.  Pt was given 
symptomatic control with viscous lidocaine and narcotics with 
nebs as needed for comfort  
*  
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Initially patient had 
elevated heart rate and was evaluated in ICU.  However, pt 
converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously after metoprolol 
administration.  He was kept on telemetry for duration of 
hospitalization but did not have elevated heart rate in days 
prior to discharge.  Pt was discharged with home medications 
amniodarone and [**Last Name (LF) 5914**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] titrate as needed. Not on 
anticoagulation at present given mass encroachment on pulmonary 
vessels. 
*  
5. Oral Herpes: pt with small lesion on left lip. This is new 
and pt has a history of previous lip sores.  
- Acyclovir 400 mg PO Five times daily x 14 days  
.  
6. Extensive stage SCLC: Some radiographic response status post 
1 cycle of chemotherapy. Pt received 1st day of second course of 
chemotherapy while inpatient to be followed up for second and 
third days as outpatient. (Carboplatin day 1, Etoposide day [**1-1**] 
q 21 d Cycle 1 and cycle 2 day 1 given in hospital
Carboplatin AUC 5 465 mg, Etoposide 80 mg/m2 = 160 mg.) 
Additionally pt was to return for neulasta on Saturday. 
*  
7. Anemia : Anemic (although hematocrit low at baseline), 
Suspect secondary to recent chemotherapy.  
- Colonoscopy shows multiple polypoid lesions, likely cause of 
bleeding. Await path report.  Pt received multiple transfusions 
with goal hct of 30 while in pre-chemotherapy status.
*  
8. FEN: Pt refused low Na diet. Electrolytes WNL.

     HISTORY:  Lung cancer.  Fever and cough.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2780-8-25**].
     
     Compared to the prior study, the size of the right hilar mass has decreased

     74-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer status post tracheobronchial
     stent placement, now with fever and cough with concern for PE or stent
     failure.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2780-8-24**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest were obtained
     without IV contrast followed by images after 90 mL of a rapid bolus of
     intravenous Optiray contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were
     also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated is the
     dominant right hilar mass which is now smaller measuring 7.7 x 6.8 cm on
     greatest axial dimension and approximately 9 cm in craniocaudal extent,
     previously 9.8 x 8.7 cm on axial measure [**2780-8-24**].  The mass encases
     the distal trachea and carina, right upper and middle lobe bronchi and
     pulmonary vessels and SVC.  While the right upper and middle lobe bronchi are
     narrowed, they are now patent.  A tracheobronchial stent remains in unchanged
     position.  Again demonstrated are small satellite lesions of the right upper
     lobe, the larger measuring 17 x 14 mm, not significantly changed. There
     remains extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy which appears largely
     stable and includes a subcarinal node which measures 16 mm in short axis.  The
     mass abuts the esophagus and there is obliteration of the fat plane.  The
     aorta and pulmonary arterial tree opacify without evidence of pulmonary
     embolism.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate new peripheral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1680**] opacity of the right upper
     and middle lobes which is nonspecific but may be infectious or inflammatory or
                                                                 (Over)

     possibly represent lymphangitic spread of tumor.  There remains thickening of
     the bronchovascular bundles of the right upper and middle lobes.  Patchy
     opacity of the posterior left lower lobe has improved.  There are now new
     small areas of consolidation of the posterobasilar portions of both lower
     lobes which may represent atelectasis but could indicate infection.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen again demonstrates a porcelain
     gallbladder and fullness of the left adrenal gland which are stable.  Small
     hypodense lesions of the liver are not well evaluated on today's study due to
     differences in contrast timing.  Small retrocrural lymph nodes are unchanged
     measuring up to 9 mm.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are extensive degenerative changes throughout the spine
     as well as of the shoulder joints but no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
     lesion is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No pulmonary embolism.
     
     2.  Decrease in size of large dominant right hilar mass.
     
     3.  Tracheobronchial stent in unchanged position.  Although the right hilar
     mass narrows the right upper and middle lobe bronchi they remain patent.
     
     4.  New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1680**] opacity of the peripheral right upper and middle lobes is
     nonspecific but may be infectious, inflammatory, or possibly represent
     lymphangitic spread of tumor.
     
     5.  New small areas of posterobasilar consolidation at both lung bases may be
     due to atelectasis but could represent infection.

     HISTORY:  Right main stem bronchus mass with new onset of shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2780-9-8**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a right upper extremity
     approach PICC line with the tip approximately 1 cm proximal to the junction of
     the right atrium and superior vena cava.  The ovoid right suprahilar mass
     remains stable. Otherwise, the lungs remain clear. There is thoracic aorta
     again appreciated. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
     There is a curvilinear radiopaque structure overlying the cardiac silhouette
     likely extrinsic to the patient.  A nodular opacity is again noted on the
     lateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm.  This is stable dating back to at
     least [**2780-3-17**].  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left
     apical pleural thickening is again appreciated and stable. Please note,
     portions of the apices are obscured by the patient's chin.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post PICC line placement as above.  No complication
     evident.  Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process.  The ovoid right suprahilar
     mass remains stable relative to the [**2780-9-8**] exam.

     CT CHEST/CT TRACHEA [**2780-9-30**]
     
     INDICATION:  Metastatic lung cancer.  Status post Y-stent in the trachea. 
     Cough and fever.  Please evaluate stent placement.
     
     Multidetector CT of the chest was performed following intravenous
     administration of 65 cc of Optiray.  Images are presented for display in the
     axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation.  A series of coronal reformation
     images are also presented for review.  Additional 3-D reconstructions and
     multiplanar reformations of the stent will be performed and an addendum will
     be issued when they become available.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2780-8-24**] and CTA of [**2780-9-8**].
     
     There has been further decrease in size of the heterogeneous soft tissue mass
     in the mediastinum surrounding the trachea.  When measurements are obtained at
     a similar level to previous scans at the level of the carina, the mass is
     decreased in size from 7.7 x 6.8 cm to 5 cm x 5.3 cm.  A Y-stent remains in
     place within the trachea and main bronchi.  Thickening of the airway wall has
     decreased in the interval in both the trachea and main bronchi as well as
     along the posterior wall of the right upper lobe bronchus.  There is now a
     size discrepancy between the stent and the airway in the trachea and carinal
     levels as well as slight size discrepancy in the proximal main bronchi. 
     Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have also decreased in size in the interval,
     particularly the subcarinal nodes.  The heart is normal in size.  There is no
     pericardial effusion or pleural effusion.
     
     Incidental note is made of a small hiatal hernia.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is calcification of the
     gallbladder wall consistent with porcelain gallbladder.  Nodular enlargement
     of the left adrenal gland is without interval change since the recent CT
     torso.  Diffuse calcification with peripheral atheromatous change in the
     abdominal aorta is noted.  Incidental note is made of calcified granulomas in
     the spleen.  Only one of the previously reported low attenuation lesions is
     still visible within the liver, measuring less than 1 cm on image 66 of series
     2.  Lack of visualization of the second hepatic lesion could potentially be
     due to differences in phase of contrast administration rather than a true
     interval resolution.

     (Cont)
     Right upper lobe nodule is minimally decreased from recent CTA, now measuring
     16 x 11 mm and previously measuring 17 x 14 mm (image 21, series 3).  Adjacent
     thickening of the bronchovascular bundles extending to the right hilum has
     also slightly improved.  Previously reported areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 1680**]
     opacification have nearly completely resolved with only minimal areas of small
     airways disease remaining in the dependent portions of the lower lobes.  There
     is mild bronchial wall thickening in both lower lobes as well.  Two tiny less
     than 5 mm diameter left lung nodules in the left upper lobe (image 14, series
     3 and image 33, series 3) are without change from the prior CT.
     
     The airways distal to the stent are widely patent.
     
     Incidental note is made of calcified granulomas within the lingula.
     
     Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
     
     CORONAL REFORMATION IMAGES:  These images confirm the presence of a Y-stent
     with size discrepancy between the stent and airway lumen most marked in the
     trachea and carina levels.  The stent appears intact.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Continued decrease in size of paratracheal mediastinal neoplastic mass.
     
     2.  Patency of Y-stent.  Decreased thickening of tracheal and bronchial walls
     with current size discrepancy between stent and airway lumen.
     
     3.  Improving mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as slight decrease
     in right apical lung nodule.
     
     4.  Marked improvement in diffuse small airways infection with residual
     minimal small airways disease in dependent portions of lower lobes.
     
     5.  Stable left adrenal nodule.
     
     6.  Only one of two small hepatic lesions from [**2780-8-24**] CT torso is
     still visible, but lack of visualization of second lesion may be technical in
     nature.

     PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2780-10-10**] and compared with
     the recent radiograph of [**2780-9-11**].  Tracheal stent is in place.  An ill-defined
     nodule is seen in the right upper lobe consistent with the recent CT of the
     chest.  A rounded nodule is also seen in the left lower lobe, near the left
     costophrenic angle.  There is no evidence of new infiltrate or pleural
     effusion since the prior examination.  Right paratracheal density is
     unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No new finding since the prior radiograph of [**2780-9-11**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Small cell lung cancer, followup.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  After administration of oral contrast, MDCT was used to obtain
     contiguous axial images through the liver followed by uneventful
     administration of IV Optiray contrast and images obtained through the torso.
     This was followed by three-minute delay images through the kidneys.
     Multiplanar reformats were obtained.  The study was compared with CT torso of
     [**2780-8-24**] and CT chest, [**2780-9-30**].  
     
     CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The right upper lobe nodule measures 10 x 15 mm,
     previously 11 x 16 mm.  The previously identified large right hilar and
     paratracheal mass is much diminished on today's study, measuring 39 mm AP by
     43 mm transverse, though it is still seen surrounding the azygos vein and the
     right main stem bronchus, and exerts minimal mass effect.  Right hilar lymph
     node measuring 17 mm is again identified.  The tracheal stent has been
     removed.  A granuloma in the medial left lingula is unchanged.
     
     There are minor atelectatic changes in both lungs.  No pleural or pericardial
     effusion is seen.  The cardiac vasculature is notable for multiple coronary
     vascular calcifications.  The aorta also contains a few mural calcifications,
     but is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection.  The right pulmonary
     artery appears prominent, but this is an unchanged finding.
     
     CT ABDOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST:  The previously identified liver
     lesions seen on the CT torso of [**2780-8-24**] are not well identified on today's
     study, and may represent differences in phase-contrast. Again seen is the
     heavily calcified wall of the gallbladder. Left adrenal adenoma is unchanged,
     measuring 17 mm.  Right adrenal is normal. Pancreas, stomach, small bowel
     loops, and right kidney are within normal limits.  Again seen is a small
     subcentimeter low-density lesion in the mid pole of the left kidney,
     unchanged.  Atherosclerotic changes with mural plaque are again seen in the
     infrarenal abdominal aorta, unchanged.  Retroperitoneal and mesenteric small
     lymph nodes seen, but none of them are pathologically enlarged.  No free fluid
     or free air is seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is seen
     without diverticulitis.  Otherwise, bowel loops are normal.  The bladder is
     partially collapsed.  The prostate is enlarged, with central calcifications.
     No lymphadenopathy is seen.  There is no free fluid or free air.
     Calcifications in both common iliac, external iliac, and internal iliac

     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  A 17 mm diameter right hilar node is not
     significantly changed.  More vague soft tissue density about the right main
     pulmonary artery in the right subcarinal region is also not significantly
     changed.  There is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Coronary
     artery calcifications are noted.  Otherwise the heart, great vessels, and
     pericardium are unremarkable.  There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
     
     A nodule in the right upper lobe (series 3, image 17) measures 16 x 9 mm in
     axial dimensions, compared to 15 x 10 mm previously.  There is patchy new
     mixed ground glass and consolidative opacity in the right apex, whose
     appearance is most suggestive of an infectious etiology.  Acute radiation
     pneumonitis is an additional differential consideration, given recent
     radiation therapy in this area.  There is also a small amount of fluid in
     azygos fissure, but this is unchanged.  Several calcified granulomas in the
     left lung are unchanged. No new nodules are identified. Calcified subcarinal
     nodes are also unchanged.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The liver appears normal.
     Gallbladder wall calcifications, namely a porcelain gallbladder, are again
     noted.  A calcified granuloma in the spleen is unchanged.  The pancreas is
     atrophic.  The appearance of the kidneys is unchanged, with at least one sub 5
     mm hypoattenuating focus in the left kidney that is too small to characterize,
     but without significant change.
     
     The stomach, small and large bowel are within normal limits.  Slightly
     prominent appearance of the medial left adrenal limb is not significantly
     changed. Atherosclerotic change in the infrarenal aorta, which is slightly
     ectatic, is not significantly changed.  There is no retroperitoneal or
     mesenteric lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.

     TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
     
     INDICATION:  Cough and on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and lung cancer,
     evaluate for etiology of cough.
     
     PA and lateral chest views obtained with patient in upright position
     demonstrate now the presence of a large right-sided hilar mass extending
     mostly in the right upper lobe area.  The surrounding pulmonary tissue has
     undergone volume loss resulting in deviation of the trachea towards the right
     and a general volume loss in the right hemithorax.  The left lung is
     hyperexpanded but does not show any pulmonary vascular congestion or new
     parenchymal infiltrates.  However, there is evidence of a granuloma on the
     left base which in comparison with previous studies appears unchanged.
     
     When comparison is made with the next recent available chest examination of
     [**2780-10-10**], marked progression of this right-sided lung mass has
     occurred.  Moderate degree of mediastinal shift is now present but the heart
     size and the appearance of the thoracic aorta is unaltered.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Marked progression of right-sided pulmonary _____ mass with
     volume loss of right hemithorax.  Peripheral pulmonary vasculature on the
     right side appears reduced in comparison with the previous study.  Left lung
     does not demonstrate pulmonary congestion or new infiltrates short of the
     previously described local granuloma.
     
     Stat. report issued because of the rapidly advancing changes.

     There has been an interval development of typical radiation changes in the
     right paramediastinal distribution, with fibrosis and distortion of the normal
     anatomy.  Again noted are several calcified granulomas in the left lung. There
     are no new lung nodules.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable.  Again seen
     gallbladder wall calcifications (porcelain gallbladder).  There are

     chemotherapy and radiation.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2781-2-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the abdomen were obtained prior to
     administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial images of the chest, abdomen,
     and pelvis were obtained following administration of 130 cc of intravenous
     contrast.  3-minute delayed views of the kidneys were obtained.
     
     CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Previously noted 17-mm right hilar node
     measures approximately 15 mm on today's study, not significantly changed.
     There is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Again noted coronary
     artery calcifications.  The heart and great vessels are otherwise
     unremarkable.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There has been interval
     development of small right-sided pleural effusion.  Again seen a nodule in the
     right upper lobe, that measures 13 mm today, compared to 15 mm previously.
     There has been an interval development of typical radiation changes in the
     right paramediastinal distribution, with fibrosis and distortion of the normal
     anatomy.  Again noted are several calcified granulomas in the left lung. There
     are no new lung nodules.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver is unremarkable.  Again seen
     gallbladder wall calcifications (porcelain gallbladder).  There are
     calcifications in the spleen consistent with prior granulomatous process.  The
     appearance of pancreas is unchanged.  Hypoattenuating lesion in the left
     kidney is too small to definitely characterize.  The adrenal glands are
     unchanged in appearance, including slight prominence of the medial limb of the
     left adrenal gland.  Extensive atherosclerotic changes in the infrarenal
     aorta, extending into iliac arteries bilaterally again seen.  There is no
     retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air and no
     free fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is diverticulosis of the
     sigmoid and descending colon, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.  The
     prostate remains mildly enlarged.  The seminal vesicles and bladder are
     unremarkable.  There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal
     lymphatic nodes.

     BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are new, multiple
     enhancing lesions in the brain parenchyma, consistent with metastases.
     They demonstrate high signal on precontrast T1-weighted images and increased
     susceptibility, consistent with blood products.  A left parietal metastasis
     measures 1.4 cm AP x 1.9 cm transverse x 1.7 cm craniocaudad (images 8:14 and
     9:20).  A left medial temporal lobe metastasis measures 1.7 cm transverse x
     1.9 cm AP x 1.2 cm craniocaudad (images 8:10 and 9:17).  There is a metastasis
     extending from the pituitary infundibulum into the hypothalamus, measuring 0.8
     cm AP x 0.6 cm transverse x 0.3 cm craniocaudad (images 8:11 and 9:13).  There
     is a metastasis in the right lateral pons, at the junction with the right
     middle cerebellar peduncle, which measures 1.0 cm transverse x 0.9 cm AP x 0.8
     cm craniocaudad (images 8:8 and 9:16).  There is a metastasis involving the
     left cerebellar tonsil and the left cerebellar hemisphere, measuring 1.6 cm
     transverse x 1.9 cm AP x 2.0 mm craniocaudad.
     
     Mild edema associated with the above-described left temporal metastasis
     results in partial compression of the temporal and occipital horns of the left
     lateral ventricle.  There is no compression of the third or fourth ventricles.
     
     There is a right frontal leptomeningeal metastasis measuring 1.4 cm transverse
     x 0.9 cm AP x 1.0 cm craniocaudad (images 8:19 and 9:13).  There is no edema
     in the adjacent right frontal lobe.
     
     Multiple small foci of high T2 signal in the periventricular and subcortical
     white matter of both cerebral hemispheres are unchanged, consistent with
     chronic microvascular disease.  The major vascular flow voids appear
     unremarkable.  Vertical linear enhancement along the anterior brainstem and
     upper cervical cord in the midline corresponds to a prominent vein.

     MR LUMBAR SPINE
     
     HISTORY:  74-year-old male with small cell lung cancer with multiple
     metastases, now with bilateral buttock pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal pre- and post-gadolinium T1, T2, STIR; axial pre- and
     post-gadolinium T1 and T2-weighted images of the lumbar spine were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Correlation is made to an MR of the head from [**2781-7-9**] as well as a
     CT of the torso from [**2781-6-11**].
     
     There is leptomeningeal enhancement along the lower visualized thoracic spine
     (which is visualized up to the T10 level) and along the conus.  There is
     nodular thickening and diffuse enhancement of the cauda equina. These findings
     are consistent with leptomeningeal metastatic disease.  The conus medullaris
     normally ends at the T12/L1 level.
     
     The visualized bone marrow signal is normal.  There is no loss of vertebral
     body heights.
     
     Multiple small Schmorl's nodes are seen at multiple levels.
     
     At L2/3, there is a mild disc bulge which is not causing canal stenosis, but
     there is mild left and mild right foraminal stenoses.
     
     At L3/4, there is a mild disc bulge with a left foraminal disc protrusion,
     which is not causing canal stenosis, but there is mild left foraminal
     stenosis.
     
     At L4/5, there is a mild disc bulge which is not causing canal stenosis, but
     there is mild right foraminal stenosis.
     
     At L5/S1, there is a mild disc bulge which is not causing canal stenosis, but
     there is mild bilateral foraminal stenoses.
     
     Within the mid portion of the right kidney is a 1.2 x 0.8 cm T2 hyperintense
     lesion which does not enhance, which likely represents a parapelvic cyst.
     
     There is an abdominal aortic aneurysm just above the aortic bifurcation, which
     measures approximately 3.1 cm in size.  This is not significantly changed
     since the prior study.
     
                                                                 (Over)

      75 year old man with SCLC, recent FICU admission for pneumonia                  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate for post-obstructive pna, consolidation                         
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  75-year-old man with small cell lung cancer, please evaluate for
     post-obstructive pneumonia.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior study done on [**2781-6-11**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
     abdomen after administration of 90 cc of Optiray intravenously.  No oral
     contrast was used.  Coronal reformatted images were obtained.
     
     CT OF CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The patient is status post radiation of the
     right lung with scarring and traction atelectasis of the right upper lobe
     which appears unchanged compared to the prior study.  Two nodular opacities
     within the right upper lobe appear unchanged measuring 13 mm in diameter.  No
     other pulmonary nodules are seen within the lungs.  Pleural-based opacity is
     noted along the lateral portion of the superior segment of the right lower
     lobe which appears unchanged compared to the prior study.
     
     There has been interval development of new peribronchiolar opacities of the
     medial and lateral segment of the right middle lobe which is a new finding and
     suggests pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.
     
     The soft tissue windows demonstrate multiple enlarged mediastinal nodes. These
     nodes are located within the anterior paratracheal space, subcarinal space and
     appear unchanged compared to the prior study.  The largest node is located in
     the anterior paratracheal space and measures 10 mm in the short axis.  The
     moderate right-sided pleural effusion extends into the fissures. The thyroid
     gland and esophagus are unremarkable.
     
     The visualized portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates normal appearance of
     the liver.  The porcelain gallbladder is unchanged.  Multiple calcified
     granulomas of the spleen is suggestive of the old granulomatous disease.  The
     right adrenal gland and the visualized portion of both kidneys are
     unremarkable.  The prominence of the medial limb of the left adrenal gland is
     unchanged.  No pathologically enlarged node is noted within the upper abdomen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
     Degenerative changes are noted at multiple levels.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval development of peribronchiolar opacities of the right middle lobe
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     consistent with pneumonia.
     2.  Right pleural effusion is unchanged.  The radiation induced atelectasis of
     the right lung is stable.
     3.  The two nodules noted within the right upper lobe are unchanged. Although
     they most likely  represent round atelectasis, tumor recurrence cannot be
     excluded. Attention to these nodules on the followup studies is recommended.
     4.  Porcelain gallbladder, unchanged.
