Admission Date:  [**3082-2-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**3082-3-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**3009-1-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Diarrhea

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
woman with chronic medical problems listed separately below
who underwent bunion surgery [**91**] days prior to presentation
(and also had a nosebleed two days prior to presentation for
which she was seen in an outside hospital Emergency
Department).  She presented to the Emergency Department
complaining of black diarrhea today.  She denied abdominal
pain, fevers, nausea, vomiting, sick contacts but has had
chills.  She reports that she was given a prescription for
Augmentin following her bunion surgery and she has taken this
medication.  For the five days prior to presentation she has
had larger volumes of diarrhea and also reports decreased
p.o. intake.

In the Emergency Department the patient underwent nasogastric
lavage with bilious return.  She received 4 liters of normal
saline for hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 92).  She
was also found to be hyperkalemic for which she received
Kayexalate 30 gm and Calcium Gluconate as well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient states that she felt thirsty.
She had no chest pain.  She states that she had two pillow
orthopnea, sleeps with bricks and pillows under the head of
her bed.  She also states that she is short of breath after
climbing a flight of stairs at her house.  She denied lower
extremity edema, nocturia or chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, she requires supplemental oxygenation at home.  2.
Congestive heart failure, her last echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea/obesity.  5.  Status post total
abdominal hysterectomy.  6.  Status post cholecystectomy on
[**3081-7-11**].  7.  Status post bilateral total knee
replacement in [**3074**].  8.  Hiatal hernia.  9.  Bunion surgery
on [**3082-2-7**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  She has
a 50 pack year smoking history.  She quit smoking
approximately 25 years ago.  Of note, her husband also has
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires
supplemental oxygenation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on presentation
revealed temperature 96.8, heartrate 83, blood pressure
89/64, respiratory rate 18 to 20.  Oxygen saturation was 94
to 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.  Generally, the patient
was comfortable, awake, alert, slightly hard of hearing.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, normocephalic, atraumatic,
anicteric, normal conjunctivae, pupils equal, round and
reactive to light from 4 ml to 2.5 ml.  Extraocular movements
intact without nystagmus.  Throat clear.  Neck:  Supple, full
range of motion, jugular veins not appreciable.  No
lymphadenopathy, thyroid not palpable.  Heart:  Point of
maximal impulse not displaced, regular, normal S1 and S2,
II/VI systolic murmur at base bilaterally, contraction of
arms.  Lungs, decreased excursion, clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen, obese, normal bowel sounds, slightly
distended, soft, not tender.  Liver edge and spleen not
palpable.  Extremities, equivocal clubbing, no rash, warm,
dry.  Sutures over second toes with rods in the second toes
bilaterally.  Vascular, radial, carotid and dorsalis pedis
pulses +2 bilaterally.  Neurologic, alert, oriented, speaking
in full sentences, intact shortterm and longterm memory.
Motor, upper extremity, lower extremity, proximal and distal
muscle strength 5/5 although she was too lightheaded to
stand.  Cerebellum, normal rapid hand movements.  Cranial
nerves II, III, IV, VI normal as above, cranial nerves V and
VII symmetric with normal sensation, cranial nerves IX, X and
XII normal gag, tongue midline, clear phonation.  Cranial
nerves [**Doctor First Name **] normal shoulder shrug.

LABORATORY DATA:  At laboratory evaluation, white blood cell
count 31.3, hematocrit 39.7, platelets 527.  Chemistry,
128/7.7, 89/20, 100/4.2, glucose 140.  Repeat chemistry panel
revealed sodium 133, potassium 6.2, chloride 95, bicarbonate
22.  Blood urea nitrogen 95, creatinine 3.9, glucose 125.
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total bilirubin,
amylase and lipase and INR were normal.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Urine electrolytes, sodium less than 10, urea
nitrogen 233, urine creatinine 202, urine potassium 65, urine
chloride less than 10.  Fractional excreted sodium was less
than 0.1%.  Electrocardiogram, sinus at 82, PR interval less
than 200 milliseconds, QRS interval was less than 120
milliseconds and the QT interval was 416 seconds.  Axis was
left with qR in leads 1 and AVL and a rS in 2, 3 and F.
There were no peak T waves, there was no acute ST segment
change.  This was consistent with left anterior fascicle
block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hyperkalemia - On the night of
admission, the patient required several additional gm of
calcium gluconate, approximately 30 units of regular insulin
and several injections of sodium bicarbonate to acutely
decrease the potassium.  She also received Kayexalate as
well.  Following rehydration her BUN and creatinine returned
to [**Location 1966**] and she had normal renal function for the duration
of the hospital course.

2.  Upon arrival in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
patient's serial blood gases revealed hypercarbia and
hypoxia.  She was intubated.  Central venous access was
established.  She received several boluses of fluids to
maintain blood pressure.  Ultimately she required
administration of pressors to maintain her blood pressure.

3.  Infectious disease - Given her history of prior surgery,
long course of antibiotics and a visit to an outside
Emergency Department, the patient was treated with
Metronidazole by mouth and intravenously for presumed
pseudomembranous colitis.  Subsequent detection of
Clostridium difficile A in her stool confirmed infection with
the [**Doctor Last Name 614**] of this disease.  She had large volumes of diarrhea
as well as increased nasogastric suctioning contents.
Ultimately her treatment for Clostridium difficile was
switched to Vancomycin per os, per rectum and intravenously.
Her white blood cell count remained elevated for the duration
of her hospital course.  Interval colonoscopy confirmed the
presence of pseudomembranes, likewise computer tomograph
evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed involvement on
the entire large colon.  Of note, the patient received a four
day course of Xigris since she met inclusion criteria of
sepsis.

4.  Hypotension - The patient had persistent hypotension
during her hospital course.  She underwent Swan-Ganz
catheterization which confirmed distributed and cardiogenic
shock.  The patient was unable to tolerate weaning from
pressor agents, specifically requiring Dopamine for the
duration of her hospital stay to maintain blood pressure.  Of
note, the patient was exquisitely sensitive to withdrawal of
this [**Doctor Last Name 614**] and would have precipitous drop in her blood
pressure as well as bradycardia upon its discontinuation.
Similarly the patient could not tolerate higher than 20
mcg/kg/min of this medication as she developed an inferior
myocardial infarction when the medication was increased to
37.

Of note, the patient had a left lower lobe consolidation on
chest x-ray.  Sputum cultures confirmed that she had
pneumonia with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
although she was initially treated with Levofloxacin for
community acquired pneumonia, the intravenous Vancomycin
administered as part of the regimen for Clostridium difficile
covered for this organism.  The patient was unable to be
weaned from assist control ventilation.  She occasionally
required increases in her fraction of inspired oxygen.

Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient continued to
have large volumes of diarrhea and was persistently
hypotensive.  After discussion with her family a decision was
made to withdraw care, specifically discontinuing pressor
agents.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pseudomembranous colitis complicated by sepsis
2.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
3.  Inferior myocardial infarction
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she requires
supplemental oxygenation at home.
5.  Congestive heart failure, her last echocardiogram showed
an ejection fraction of 40 to 45%.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 314**] apnea/obesity.
8.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
9.  Status post cholecystectomy on [**3081-7-11**].
10. Status post bilateral total knee replacement in [**3074**].
11. Hiatal hernia.
12. Bunion surgery on [**3082-2-7**].

     density lesions within both kidneys, likely cysts.  There is no
     retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The opacified loops of small bowel are
     normal in caliber.  The abdominal portions of the colon are fluid filled but
     no dilated.  This would be consistent with known diarrhea.
     
     PELVIS:  Foley catheter is present within the bladder.  There is no definite
     inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  No free pelvic fluid.  Contrast does not
     reach the rectum, but the pelvic loops of large bowel are similarly filled
     with fluid and no dilated.  The appendix is well visualized and appears
     normal.

     CHEST, [**3082-2-27**]:
     
     INDICATION:  COPD.  Admitted with sepsis.  Check ETT placement.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP semi-upright view.  The ETT appears well positioned
     with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina.  The left subclavian central
     line tip remains in stable position in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.
     The heart again shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement.  There is a
     suggestion of upper zone redistribution, bibasilar blurring of lung parenchyma
     and bilateral small pleural effusions, consistent with left ventricular
     failure.  In addition there is again evidence of left lower lobe collapse and
     consolidation behind the heart.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Satisfactory placement of ETT.
     2)  Cardiomegaly and probable left ventricular failure.  Bibasilar
     infiltrates.  Left lower lobe collapse and consolidation.  Bilateral
     effusions.

     PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST:  The left subclavian central venous catheter tip is
     appropriately positioned in the brachiocephalic vein, close to the confluence
     with the SVC.  The catheter itself shows no evidence of kinking or disruption.
     The only area of possible abnormality is a slight area of tapering or
     narrowing of the catheter at the site of the adaptor, external to the patient.
     The ETT is in satisfactory position.  The NG tube is coiled in the stomach,

     There is moderate cardiomegaly, stable in degree.  The pulmonary vascularity
     remains indistinct, with upper zone vascular redistribution, consistent with
     CHF.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities, improved at the right base, but
     unchanged at the left base.  This likely reflects areas of atelectasis.  There
     are small bilateral pleural effusions, left slightly greater than right.

Neuro:  Pt on Fentanyl 100 mcg/hr and versed 2mg/hr.  She was waking up and answering questions appropriately.  The Fentanyl was decreased to 75mcg/hr and the versed was dropped to 1mg/hr.  She was slightly more awake but still not breathing when tried on PSV so the fentanyl was dropped to 50mcg/hr and the versed was dropped to 0.5 mg/hr.  She is still very somulent but responding to verbal stimuli.  She did attempt to reach so her hands were restrained for her safety.

Resp:  Vent settings at 8am were A/C 600 x16 Peep 5 FiO2 40%.  She was attempted on PSV total of three trials, the first 2 times she was apneic which is why the sedation was decreased.  The third time she was able to tolerate PSV 10/Peep5.  She was suctioned x3 for mod amount of whitish secretions.  

Cardiac:  B/P was 100-110/60 with HR low 60's all day.  Right after the change to and the bicarb ended she started to drop her B/P to 80's.  She was given 250cc bolus with little effect so the dopa was increased to 11mcg/kg/hr.  HR was 66-69 with Occ to frequent PVC's.  Lyte checked at 1800.  CVP checked at 1800, it was [**6-3**].  

GI:  NGT remains in place.  Hypoactive bowel sounds but no attempt to feed her.  Continues to have [**Male First Name (un) 726**] colored stool but in smaller amounts.  Continues on TPN.  BS at 12n was 220 covered with 4u Reg insulin.  1800 BS was 142.  

GU:  U/O was 80-100cc/hr while receiving the bicarb gtt but after it was ended her U/O dropped to 30-40cc/hr.  Will monitor the effect of the 250cc bolus.

     positioning, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  The pulmonary
     vascularity is indistinct, consistent with congestive heart failure. There are

Review of systems:

Neuro: Pt. is sedated, arouses easily to any stimuli, MAE, opens eyes. Does not follow commands. Fentanyl @ 100 mcg/hr, Versed @ 2 mg/hr to maintain comfort; no boluses given as these have made pt. hypotensive in past. 

Resp: Pt. remains intubated and vented on A/C 600x16 FiO2 60% PEEP 5 with occasional overbreathing during stimulation. O2 sats consistently are 96-97%. Lungs are coarse upper, diminished lower. Sxn'd pt. q 2-4 hrs. for thick yellow secretions. Abg on these settings this AM was 7.37/36/80/-[**3-18**]. Plans for today will probably include another weaning trial on PS. RSBI this AM was 107; pt. became very agitated when taken of A/C mode.

CV: BP range 80-110/40-60's with MAPs 56-80's. HR remains SR with occasional PVCs in the 70's. Dopa at rate as described above. Vasopressin ordered and in room, but Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 557**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] would like to hold off for now, maintain BP with fluid boluses and by increasing Dopamine. + generalized edema. Good peripheral pulses.

GI: + BS x 4, abd. soft, obese, not tender. TFs continue to be held awaiting MD orders. OGT clamped, residuals milky green, similar in color/consistency to stool. Rectal foley with mod. amts. liquid green stool, slightly guiac +. TPN continues @ 79.2 cc/hr. Monitor residuals, continue TPN, reassess pt.'s readiness to re-start TFs.

GU: Foley patent, draining 50-80 cc/hr amber urine with sediment. NSS @ 125 cc/hr. TFB was +4L @ MN, +1.5L @ 0600, +24.8L for LOS. 

ID: Tmax 100.7 @ MN, given Tylenol x 1 @ 0400. Awaiting AM labs to check WBC. Abx regimen remains IV Vanco, Levaquin and IV/PO Flagyl for C-Diff sepsis.

     INDICATION:  Sepsis.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3082-3-3**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube and right SVC remain in place.  Cardiomegaly
     persists.  Right lower lobe infiltrate and some fluid layering out are noted.
     This is more prominent than that seen previously but prior study was an
     entirely different obliquity.  Upper lungs are clear.  Superimposed upon the
     findings previously mentioned are prominent pulmonary vessels consistent with
     fluid overload.
     
     The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged and there is no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Right lower lobe consolidation (likely worse) and fluid layering out.
     
     Superimposed fluid overload.

Events of shift: Pt. becoming hypotensive to the 80/40's, MAP 50's, thermodilution C.O. down to 3.8 at start of shift. Dopa increased to max 20 mcg/kg/min with little effect. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware; Vasopressin started @ 0.04 u/min with good effect, able to wean Dopa to keep MAP>65. CO, PAP, PCWP and PVR trending down over shift; SVR trending up; team aware. Pt. experiencing periods of desaturation to the high 80's, so FiO2 increased to 50% with return of O2 sats to the 90's and a good abg. Unable to go off floor for CT scan of body because of episodes described above; of note, pt. not able to tolerate PO contrast, she does not seem to be absorbing anything given per NGT. Lg. amts. stool leaking from around rectal foley, foley replaced with mushroom cath.

Review of systems:

Neuro: Pt. remains sedated on multiple gtts, opens eyes, MAE, becomes agitated with small amts. of stimulation; on Fentanyl 250 mcg/hr and Versed 3 mg/hr.

Resp: Pt. remains intubated and vented, current settings are A/C 600 x 16 FiO2 50% PEEP 5, pt. overbreathing vent rarely. Lungs are coarse T/O and dim in bilateral bases. Sxn'd infrequently for small->copious amts. thick yellow/white secretions. Pt. bagged and suctioned x 1 tonight with little result. No plans to wean pt. today.

CV: Swan-ganz catheter in place, see flowsheet for most recent numbers. BP currently 100/50's with MAP 70's on Dopa 14 mcg/kg/min and Vasopressin @ 0.04 u/min; BP is very labile and is strongly affected by ANY change in rate of Dopamine, even for short periods. Peripheral pulses are weak, hands are especially cyanotic and cold. Team aware. + generalized edema.

GI: + BS x 4, abd. obese, soft, not tender. Continuous high residuals via NGT overnight; TFs continue to be held for this reason. Pt. is maintained on TPN @ 79.2 cc/hr. Mushroom cath initially with stool leaking around it, flushed with soap + H2o, stool now passing through catheter without problems.

GU: Foley patent, draining 60-100 cc/hr amber urine with sediment. Yesterday, pt. was + 6.4L for the day; she is currently +31L for LOS. NSS @ 125/hr maintenance rate.

Skin: Bilateral bunion dressings changed; incisions are approximated, no drainage noted. Duoderm removed from small stage II sacral ulcer, 3-in-1 barrier cream applied. Small stage II ulcers under panus and R breast covered with same barrier cream. Nystatin powder applied to other folds and between legs for red rash. 

ID: WBC up to 27.3 this AM, pt. remains afebrile today. Currently being treated with IV Levaquin and Vanco and IV/PO Flagyl for C-Diff colitis. 

Access: R groin A-line becomes dampened easily. RSC Swann-ganz catheter kinked at insertion site; site re-dressed, steri-strips applied in an attempt to keep it in correct position. 

Social: Multiple family members in to visit pt. at start of shift; updated on pt.'s plan of care by RNs. Pt.'s daughter [**Name (NI) 1189**] called this AM, was updated by RN re: pt.'s eventful night.

     INDICATION:  Sepsis; line placement.
     
     Comparison: [**3082-3-4**] at 16:29
     
     FINDINGS:  A right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with the tip in the left
     main pulmonary outflow tract. There is a left-sided CVL with tip in the
     brachiocephalic region. The endotracheal tube is noted with tip 4.6 cm above
     the carina.
     
     The patient is angled quite differently and at an opposite oblique position.
     This may create appearance of increased density in the left upper lobe.
     However, that should be reassessed on subsequent follow-up films for possible
     evolving infiltrate. Bilateral effusions are again seen but appear slightly
     increased in size and the left retrocardiac area appears more dense. Pneumonia
     could be present.
     
     Right lung is stable and pulmonary vascular markings appear no different.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Increased pleural effusions bilaterally and increased
     retrocardiac density. Follow-up recommended to assess for possible evolving
     left upper lobe infiltrate. Positioning differences are quite marked when
     comparing the two studies.

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.
     
     INDICATION:  History of C. diff sepsis/colitis with persistently rising white
     count.
     
     Comparison is made to a prior examination of [**3082-2-25**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced images of the abdomen and pelvis were performed
     following the administration of 150 cc of IV Optiray.  Nonionic IV contrast
     was used due to the patient's condition.  Images were reconstructed in the
     coronal plane.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is bilateral small pleural effusions
     with associated bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.  Since the prior exam,
     there has been development of a moderate-to-large amount of ascites and
     subcutaneous soft tissue edema, greater on the left, consistent with anasarca.
     The liver is normal in appearance.  The patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.  There is a 2.2 cm well delineated lesion in the lower pole
     of the right kidney and in the midpole of the left kidney, with Hounsfield
     units suggestive that they are probable angiomyolipomas.  In addition, a small
     likely simple cyst is seen in the upper pole of the left kidney.  The kidneys
     are otherwise normal in appearance.  The stomach and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is no free air.  The large bowel demonstrates pancolonic
     wall thickening.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There appears to be a focal air collection
     within the superior portion of the bladder, likely related to Foley catheter
     insertion.  No pelvic lymph node enlargement.  No pelvic masses.  The
     intrapelvic colon demonstrates thickening of the wall.  No pelvic free fluid
     or collection seen.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate multiple sclerotic foci within the lumbar spine,
     likely representing bone islands.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive
     atelectasis/consolidation.
     2.  Moderate-to-large amount of ascites with subcutaneous soft tissue edema
     consistent with anasarca.

     3.  Pancolitis with evidence of wall thickening.
     4.  Bilateral kidney lesions likely represent angiomyolipomas by Hounsfield
     units, although measurements are somewhat unreliable due to artifact. In the
     nonacute setting, ultrasound could be performed to confirm these findings.
     5.  No evidence of abscess or bowel obstruction.

     subcutaneous soft tissue edema, greater on the left, consistent with anasarca.
     The liver is normal in appearance.  The patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.  There is a 2.2 cm well delineated lesion in the lower pole
     of the right kidney and in the midpole of the left kidney, with Hounsfield
     units suggestive that they are probable angiomyolipomas.  In addition, a small
     likely simple cyst is seen in the upper pole of the left kidney.  The kidneys
     are otherwise normal in appearance.  The stomach and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  There is no free air.  The large bowel demonstrates pancolonic
     wall thickening.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There appears to be a focal air collection
     within the superior portion of the bladder, likely related to Foley catheter
     insertion.  No pelvic lymph node enlargement.  No pelvic masses.  The
     intrapelvic colon demonstrates thickening of the wall.  No pelvic free fluid
     or collection seen.
