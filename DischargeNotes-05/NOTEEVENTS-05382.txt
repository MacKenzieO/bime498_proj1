Admission Date:  [**2907-6-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2907-7-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2861-6-1**]       Sex:  M

Service:  BLUMGART

STAT ADDENDUM:

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital 6342**] Medical service
on [**2907-7-2**] from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
This is a continuation of the [**Hospital 1032**] hospital course.  The
previous dictation the Medical Intensive Care Unit course has
already been dictated.

CONTINUATION HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the 13th, the patient was
transferred.

1.  PULMONARY:  Ears, nose and throat continued to follow the
patient.  The patient was maintained on his original regimen,
humidified O2 via the face shovel mask and was encouraged to
have suction qid to the back of the pharynx and was continued
to be monitored.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  1.  Swallow study:  The patient had
failed swallow study previously in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was reevaluated.  Reevaluation via oropharynx video
showed aspiration on both thick and thin liquids.  However,
upon further discussion aspiration on nectar thick felt to be
one of patient's suboptimal efforts where the patient was
rushed using straw, therefore recommendation was made to
allow the patient to continue on a honey thick diet with
puree with careful supervision of all meals.  No straws to be
used, encouraged the patient to go slowly with three swallows
per bite.  The patient did well, was reevaluated and advanced
to nectar thick liquids.  Recommendations were also made to
have medications crushed and placed in puree, although
patient did do well with small pills without being crushed.
The goal is for the patient to receive rehabilitation and
then have the swallow study repeated to monitor for
improvement.

For the patient's cirrhosis, hepatology service
recommendation was continue to swallow and make
recommendations.  The patient was continued on his doses of
lactulose, spironolactone with a goal diuresis each day of
minus 500 cc.  MRI of the abdomen was done to evaluate the
liver which showed moderate ascites, splenomegaly and a liver
contour consistent with cirrhosis.  No abnormal liver masses
or enhancement were found and the portal vein was patent.
For the esophageal varices, the patient has a follow up
appointment on [**2907-7-15**] at 10 a.m.  The patient is to
come at 9 to [**Hospital Ward Name **] Eight for a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding.

On the [**7-6**], the patient complained of pain per
rectum, thought it was reminiscent of patient's hemorrhoids.
Upon examination, it was found to have an approximately 1 cm
draining perirectal abscess.  The abscess was tender, but
showed no signs of infection and was draining serosanguinous
fluid.  Instructions were to keep the wound clean and dry,
follow patient's white count which did not rise and the
patient remained afebrile.

3.  NEUROLOGY:  Patient with hepatic encephalopathy versus
seizures.  The repeat EEG was done which showed no signs of
seizure activity.  The patient remained seizure free and was
continued on Neurontin 300 mg 3x a day and Dilantin 350 mg
broken up in 150 mg in the morning, 100 mg in the p.m. and
100 mg in the evening.  The patient is to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1318**] of neurology.

4.  DECONDITIONING:  Patient with a stage 1 decubitus sacral
ulcer noted recommending position change q2h with use of
barrier cream.  Overall, the patient did well while in the
hospital, although complained of feeling weak secondary to
deconditioning.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to
rehabilitation today.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Alcohol cirrhosis with esophageal variceal bleed
2.  Hepatic encephalopathy

liquids with supervision during all meals.  No straws to be
used.  The patient is to take small bites and sips and
encouraged to go slowly, for example three swallows per bite.
 Large medications are to be crushed and placed in puree for
administration.  The patient is to have position changed q2h
and monitoring of the stage 1 sacral decubitus with use of
barrier cream.  Perirectal abscess should be kept clean and
dry and monitored.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with gastrointestinal
for esophagogastroduodenoscopy banding with banding on [**2907-7-15**], 10 a.m. at [**Hospital Ward Name **] Eight.  The patient is to arrive

Neuro: Pt remained unresponsive, staring out into space when first assessed this shift. He withdrew to painful stimuli in his feet but no response to hand grasps. Pupils equal and reactive 3-4mm bilateral. He began to have seizures noted at about 5:30PM and between then until 7:30 PM he had four more generalized tonic seizures noted which lasted 30seconds and was primarily noted to occur on the left side. He was given 2mg IV ativan while having a seizure down in CT. Emergent head CT was negative. Will now be started on dilantin and will watch for further seizures and response to treatment. Ordered for 500mg IV dilantin bolus. Will need level checked later tonight to see where he is at. ? etiology of seizures.

CV/Fluid/electrolytes: BP stable so far this shift ranging  100-120. HR 50's-60's with occ PVC. MG was down to 1.6, repleted with 2gm IV. K+ 3.9. Phos was low and he is pordered for increased dose as well as two packets now times one. He was given a dose of mannitol 70gm IV over one hour to see if he would wake up any if his neuro status was related to increased ICP. He did not wake up any after the dose and his UO has increased greatly. He will not continue on the mannitol.

Resp: No vent changes this shift. Remains on IMV 12, 40%, 700TV with good sats. Suctioned three times for white secretions. Oral secretions are bloody.

     HISTORY: Cirrhosis, encephalopathy, evaluate for portal vein thrombosis and
     amount of ascites.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Limited abdominal ultrasound.
     
     FINDINGS: The liver is heterogeneous with diffuse increased echogenicity
     consistent with cirrhosis.  There is an ill defined area of heterogeneity in
     the right lobe of the liver.   There is a moderate amount of fluid within the
     abdomen. Color Doppler of the portal vein was not possible. Doppler wave form
     shows faint signal within the portal vein, with decreased velocity. Flow is
     present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Cirrhosis.  There is a heterogeneous, ill defined area in the right lobe
     which may be further evaluated with MRI to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma.
     
     2. Moderate amount of ascites.
     
     3. Faint Doppler signal in the portal vein. Although flow is demonstrated
     evaluation with MRI may exclude the possibility of partial thrombosis.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Hepatic encephalopathy, H/o lingual CA and x-ray therapy.
     
     The video oropharyngeal swallow study was performed in conjunction with the
     speech therapist.  Contrast material of multiple consistencies was given.
     There is vallecular residue on all solid consistencies, not decreased with
     compensatory maneuvers.  There is decreased laryngeal elevation and decreased
     epiglottic inversion.  There is aspiration on both thin liquids and nectar-
     thickened liquids with inconsistent clearing and a potentially delayed cough.
     There is leftward deviation of the esophagus and larynx, but contrast passes
     freely through the esophagus with no holdup.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Aspiration of nectar-thickened and thin liquids with inconsistent clearing.
     2. Vallecular residue on all solid consistencies, not decreased with
     compensatory maneuvers.
     
     3. Leftward deviation of the esophagus and larynx may represent post
     surgical/radiation changes vs. recurrent mass.  If indicated, cross-sectional
     imaging of the neck could be considered.

      46 year old man with esophageal varicies bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, 
      cirrhosis
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evluate liver for abnormalities seen on RUQ U/S                                 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  46 y/o with history of esophageal variceal bleeding, hepatic
     encephalopathy.  Please evaluate liver for abnormality identified on recent
     ultrasound examination.
     
     COMPARISONS: Direct comparison is made to most recent MRI abdominal
     examination dated [**2905-10-21**], most recent CT abdominal examination dated [**2905-9-24**]
     and most recent ultrasound abdominal examination dated [**2907-6-19**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were obtained through the
     abdomen including STIR, T1 weighted TURBO FLASH both before and after the
     administration of contrast and HASTE.  Note that a nonbreath hold protocol was
     utilized due to patient's inability to hold his breath for extended periods of
     time.  This, along with patient motion during the remainder of the
     examination, limits the spatial resolution obtained during this examination.
     
     Multiplanar reconstruction images were generated and evaluated on the work
     station.
     
     MR ABDOMEN WITH AND W/O CONTRAST:  The liver displays a nodular contour and a
     heterogenous intensity pattern.  There is a moderate amount of ascites and the
     spleen is enlarged with a maximum dimension of approximately 15 cm.  These
     findings are consistent with liver cirrhosis and are not significantly changed
     compared with the most recent MRI and CT examinations.  The previously
     identified regenerative nodules in segment 7 of the liver on the most recent
     MRI examination are not appreciated on today's examination but this is likely
     due to the decreased spatial resolution on today's examination.  No abnormal
     masses or areas of abnormal arterial enhancement are identified in the liver.
     The area of heterogeneous echotexture in the right lobe of the liver
     identified on the recent ultrasound examination shows no definite focal
     correlate on today's MRI examination.  The portal vein is patent.
     
     There is a right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis at the right lung
     base. Aortocaval lymphadenopathy with a maximum dimension of 1.8 cm and
     retrocaval lymphadenopathy with a maximum dimension of 1.2 cm are again
     identified and not significantly changed compared with the most recent CT
     examination.  Again identified are paraesophageal varices.  No focal splenic
     lesions are identified, the adrenal glands are within normal limits. The
     gallbladder wall is mildly thickened, this is likely due to the surrounding
     ascitic fluid.  A simple cyst is again identified in the mid portion of both
     kidneys and not significantly changed.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  Note
     that both the dilatation of the side branches of the main pancreatic duct in
                                                                 (Over)

     (Cont)
     the region of the body and cystic structure identified in the pancreatic head
     on the most recent MRI examination are not appreciated on today's examination
     and this is likely due to limited spatial resolution on today's examination.
     
     MULTIPLANAR RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above stated findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Imaging findings consistent with cirrhosis.
     2. No abnormal liver masses or abnormal areas of enhancement are identified
     within the liver.

     Comparison was done with previous MR from [**2907-7-4**] and with previous ultrasound
     from [**2907-6-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is small, altough the left lobe is relatively larger. The
     echo texture of the liver is heterogeneous.  In the lateral aspect of the
     right lobe of the liver there is an ill-defined hypoechoic area with no
     borders. This area may represent confluent fibrosis.  No other masses are seen
     in the liver.
     
     Moderate amount of right pleural effusion is defined.
     
     Moderate amount of ascites is defined.
