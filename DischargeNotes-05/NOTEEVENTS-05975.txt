Date of Birth:   [**2490-2-28**]       Sex:  F

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 43-year-old female,
who complained of confusion over the last few days prior to
admission with increased fatigue while at [**Hospital 7533**] Hospital
for alcohol detoxification.  She was admitted to there on
[**2533-7-2**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denied headache, blurred vision.
Had positive nausea.  Denies any head trauma.  Patient was
recently started on Ativan at an outside hospital, and we are
unsure when her last drink of alcohol was.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Murmur.

PREVIOUS MEDICATIONS:
1. Ativan.
2. Thiamine.
3. Folate.
4. Wellbutrin.
5. Trazodone.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is known to drink three six packs of
beer a day.  Denies any history of seizures or DT's.  Denies
any other drug abuse.  Patient socially had worked at
Horizon.  Currently is homeless and unemployed.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature was 99.7, heart rate 100, blood
pressure 99/60, respirations 16, O2 saturation is 97%.
General:  In no acute distress.  Disoriented.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Mucous membranes are dry.  Cardiac:  She was regular rhythm
and rate, tachycardic.  Respirations:  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, positive
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without edema.
Neurologic:  The patient was alert, disoriented.  Pupils:
Extraocular movements are intact.  EOMIs were full.
Strength:  She was moving all extremities.  Babinski:  She
had downgoing.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.

LABORATORIES:  White count of 3.1, hematocrit of 31.4,
platelets of only 28.  Sodium of 136, potassium 3.7, chloride
102, 23 for CO2, BUN was 5, and creatinine 0.3, 84 for
glucose.  PT was 15.1, PTT 37.2, INR 1.5.  LFTs showed ALT of
40, AST of 142, AT 149, lipase 40, amylase 44.  Ammonia was
39.

Head CT scan showed chronic versus subacute left subdural
hematoma.

Patient was admitted to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit, where
her coagulopathy was reversed.  Patient was monitored for her
blood pressure to keep less than 150.  An A-line was placed
for closer monitoring.  Was given medications for nausea and
her LFTs and platelets were monitored closely.  She was also
put on Venodyne boots.

On the [**8-5**], patient was opening eyes to stimulation.
Her pupils were 4 to 3.  She was oriented x1.  Continued to
transfuse her platelets to a goal of 100, and she got 2 units
of fresh-frozen plasma to get her INR at a goal of 1.3.
Patient had a repeat CT scan which did not show any worsening
of the acute versus chronic subdural hematoma.

Patient continued to be monitored in the unit in the 24th,
where her INR and platelets were continued to be fixed, her
vital signs were monitored hourly.

On the 25th, the patient was transferred to the General
Surgical Floor, where at times she did need to be posied due
to her alertness.  She was only oriented x1.  She seemed to
have more behavior issues at night.  Over the next few days,
the patient's mental status did improve, and she was alert
and oriented, moving all extremities.  She was seen by
Physical Therapy, who on the [**8-9**] cleared her for no
longer needing their services.

Socially, the patient stated she had no place to go.  She is
homeless.  She did have a mother, who is also an alcoholic,
and she did not want to stay with her.  At that point, we did
have Psychiatry get involved, who came and saw the patient
and felt that she needed inpatient detox.  Also at that time,
they recommended that she be seen by Hepatology for increased
LFTs.  They did see her, and felt that she would need to
followup after detox, and she was given a phone number to
followup with our Hepatology Clinic.

Her last set of LFTs were ALT was 49, AST 140, bilirubin was
2.1.  Also she did have a followup chest x-ray on [**7-13**]
to followup on a consolidation that she had, which now showed
a normal chest x-ray.

Patient is cleared medically to go to acute detox center with
the following discharge medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Trazodone 50 mg one at bedtime.
2. Acetaminophen 325 mg [**1-15**] every 4-6h as needed.
3. Folic acid 1 everyday.
4. Thiamine 100 mg one everyday.
5. Lopressor 50 mg 0.5 bid.
6. Multivitamins one po q day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow up in the Hepatology Clinic
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3885**] with a phone number of [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1196**].  We
have asked them to schedule her to followup in 4-6 weeks, and
we are awaiting a date currently.  The patient also has a
follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 281**] on the [**6-17**], and she needs to have a CT scan of her head done at 9
o'clock in the am on the [**6-17**] with a follow-up
appointment at 10:30 on the [**6-17**].

Patient was discharged neurologically and medically intact.

     INDICATION:  Abnormal LFTs and history of alcohol abuse.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Right upper quadrant ultrasound.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     FINDINGS:  This exam is limited due to lack of cooperation by the patient.
     There is a diffuse courseness in echotexture, perhaps indicative of cirrhosis.
     There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The common bile
     duct measures 4.6 mm.  No focal abnormalities are detected.  The portal vein
     is patent and demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is
     unremarkable, without evidence of stones, wall thickening, or pericholecystic
     fluid.  Views of the pancreas are markedly limited secondary to overlying
     bowel gas.  No ascites is present.
     
     IMPRESSION: Coursed hepatic echotexture without any acute abnormalities.
     This may be related to cirrhosis although other diffuse hepatic diseases can
     not be excluded. Correlation with clinical history is suggested. If
     clinically warranted, and MRI of the liver could be performed for further
     evaluation

     INDICATION: Hypoxia.
     
     FINDINGS: There are no studies available for comparison.
     
     The heart size is in the upper limits of normal. There is evidence of
     bilateral symmetric ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates which are most prominent
     in the perihilar region. There is evidence of a retrocardiac pulmonary
     parenchymal opacity consistent with collapse/consolidation of the left lower
     lobe. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally which may
     represent bilateral pleural effusion. The pulmonary vessels are obscured.
     There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The soft tissues and osseous structures
     are unremarkable. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral symmetric ill-defined perihilar pulmonary opacities. The
     differential diagnosis for this finding includes left heart failure secondary
     to overhydration, an aspiration event, or less likely, an atypical pulmonary
     infection. A follow-up chest radiograph is advised to better assess this
     finding.

     Compared to previous study of 5 days earlier.
     
     INDICATION: Re-evaluate left lower lobe.
     
     The lung volumes are improved in the interval. Cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are within normal limits for technique. There has been marked
     interval improved aeration at the lung bases with resolution of the previously
     noted left retrocardiac abnormality. The lungs appear grossly clear.
     
     IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of previously noted left retrocardiac opacity.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      43 year old woman with ms change and heavy etoh use and fall. 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      follow-up traumatic subdural hematoma
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Follow up traumatic subdural hematoma. Comparison is made to prior
     CT head on [**2533-7-5**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT head without contrast.
     
     FINDINGS: There is again seen a left-sided isodense collection along the
     convexity representing a chronic subdural hematoma.  The collection appears
     stable in size.  There are no other areas of hemorrhage.  There is no shift of
     normally midline structures or mass effect.  The ventricles, cisterns and
     sulci again appear prominent consistent with atrophy.  The visualized osseous
     and paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable.
     
     FINDINGS: Chronic subdural hematoma stable in size without evidence of acute
     bleed.
