Admission Date:  [**2618-12-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2619-1-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2539-2-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  General Surgery

ADDENDUM:

CONCISE HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was to be discharged to
rehab, however, the night before he was to go he spiked a
temperature up to 103 and had some mental status changes.  At
that time a chest x-ray was done, urine culture, blood
culture sent, however, after talking with the family and the
situation being a possible new stroke versus sepsis in depth
discussions were done with the family.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the
attending surgeon had in depth discussions with the patient
both preoperative and postoperative concerning his wishes and
although he did not want surgical intervention at that time
he did not wish to have a prolonged dependence on medical
care.  Due to his deteriorating status he and the family
communicated their wish to not receive any additional
intervention at this point and they requested supportive care
only.  We established a DNR and DNI status and also moved to
comfort measures only.  On postoperative day eleven the
patient was to be discharged home with hospice care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient stable, currently
afebrile, however, mental status still decreased, no IV
fluids, no Foley catheter, some diffuse tenderness in the
abdomen, central line out.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with hospice care.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post exploratory laparotomy
secondary to small bowel obstruction, small bowel resection,
right MCA stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma, ethanol
abuse, hypertension.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:
1.  The patient will be followed at home with palliative
    care.
2.  The patient and the family is to follow up with [**Doctor Last Name **]
    as necessary.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ativan 1 mg sublingual q3 hours p.r.n.
2.  Artificial tears p.r.n.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Scopoline patch q3 days.
5.  Morphine sulfate elixir sublingual 5 to 20 mg p.r.n.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Facial droop, right lateral gaze with left-sided neglect.  Rule
     out stroke.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted imaging of the brain was performed.
     Diffusion weighted scans were obtained.
     
     3D time of flight MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 405**] was performed.
     Multiplanar reformatted images and source image data were reviewed.
     
     2D time of flight MR angiography of the cervical vasculature was performed. 3D
     time of flight MR angiography of the carotid bifurcations was also obtained.
     Multiplanar reformatted images and source image data were reviewed.
     
     Axial and coronal post gadolinium T1 weighted scans of the brain were obtained
     due to the patient's previous history of carcinoma.
     
     Comparison is made to the previous CT of [**2618-12-22**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Diffusion weighted images demonstrate increased signal (restricted
     diffusion) extending through the right hemispheric structures, including the
     insular, temporal, frontal and anterior parietal lobes.  Areas of restricted
     diffusion are patchy, indicating multiple sites of infarction within the right
     middle cerebral arterial vascular distribution.  There is increased T2 signal
     evident in the right posterior insular and portions of the right posterior and
     superior temporal lobe, consistent with infarction.  There is mild gyral
     swelling.  The ventricles remain normal in size and configuration.  There is
     no susceptibility artifact to indicate the presence of blood products.
     
     Scattered areas of microvascular infarction are identified in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 20**]
     nuclei and cerebral white matter, both on CT and MR examinations.  There are
     two small cerebellar hemispheric lacunar infarctions as well.
     
     Post gadolinium images are limited by patient motion, but no gross abnormal
     intracranial enhancement is seen.
     
     MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 405**] is limited by patient motion artifact.
     There is evidence of flow in the basilar artery and in both carotid arteries,
     but vascular evaluation is otherwise limited by motion artifacts.
     
     MRA of the cervical vasculature demonstrates flow in both cerebral carotid and
                                                                 (Over)

     vertebral arteries.  Again, motion artifact limits detailed evaluation of the
     carotid bifurcations and internal carotid arteries.  There are irregularities
     evident in the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally, some of which
     are clearly due to motion, but atherosclerotic narrowing cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Acute right hemispheric infarction, in the distribution of the
     middle cerebral artery territory.
     
     Extremely limited MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 405**].  MR angiography of
     the cervical vasculature demonstrates flow in both cervical carotid and
     vertebral arteries.
     
     Post contrast images of the brain are limited by motion artifact. No large
     abnormally enhancing masses are identified within the intracranial space.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Small bowel obstruction, blood in stool.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of intravenous
     contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  Oral contrast and 150 cc of Optiray was administered per patient
     request.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST: There is a small left pleural effusion.  There is
     right lower lobe bronchiectasis.  There is minimal atelectasis at the left
     lung base.  The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No
     focal lesions are present.  The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
     An NG tube is present within the stomach.  In the upper portion of the spleen
     there is a 2.9 cm x 4.7 cm area of low attenuation  likely due to splenic
     infarct. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. Multiple
     diverticula are noted throughout the colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
     The barium within the colon is present from the previous video swallow
     examination.  The barium within the small bowel does not pass through the
     entirety of the small bowel.  There are multiple dilated fluid filled proximal
     loops of small bowel. Within the right lower quadrant there are several
     collapsed loops of small bowel.  There is no free fluid or free air within the
     abdomen. There is no significant adenopathy.  There is a 6.9-cm abdominal
     aortic aneurysm with thrombus surrounding the aortic lumen. There is no
     evidence of dissection. Calcification are present surrounding the periphery of
     the aneurysm.  The aneurysm displaces the duodenum anteriorly and the IVC to
     the right.  The aneurysm extends from the level of the celiac axis to the
     iliac bifurcation. The renal arteries are superior to the aneurysm.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple diverticula are noted
     without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is a 3-cm segment of small bowel
     which demonstrates thickening and surrounding fat stranding. Small gas
     collections are present in this region but the intra- versus extraluminal
     nature is uncertain. This region is the probable zone of transition. There is
     no free fluid within the pelvis. Foley catheter is present within the urinary
     bladder.
     
     The osseous structure demonstrate degenerative change.
     
     IMPRESSION:
                                                                 (Over)

     1) Small bowel obstruction with a transition point likely within the right
     lower quadrant involving the  ileum.  In the RLQ there is a thickened segment
     of small bowel, associated mesenteric fat stranding and adjacent air
     collections ?intra- versus extraluminal. Possibility of ischemia is raised. No
     mass lesions are present to suggest metastatic melanoma.
     2)  7-cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
     3) Multiple diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
     4) There is a hypodense lesion within the spleen, likley due to infarct
     5) Mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation, cause undetermined.

     who were both present and supervising the entire procedure.
     
     INDICATIONS: This patient is a 79-year-old male with an asymptomatic 7-cm
     abdominal aortic aneurysm noted incidentally on a CT scan for a small bowel
     obstruction. He presents for aortogram with evaluation for possible endograft
     repair.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND CONTRAST: The patient received no IV sedation during the
     procedure, however was continuously hemodynamically monitored throughout the
     case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc
     of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.
     
     TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine
     position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and
     draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with
     the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine
     local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral
     artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the
     right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade
     and 0.035"" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the
     lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its
     side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the
     wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and
     abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter
     tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and
     left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed.
     Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was
     removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with
     manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure
     well. No immediate complications were noted.
     
     FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal
     celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single
     bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than
     the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is
     13 cm. The distance from the aortic bifurcation to the right iliac bifurcation

     case. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine were used as local anesthesia and a total of 240 cc
     of Optiray 60% contrast was used throughout the case.
     
     TECHNIQUE: After consent was obtained, patient was placed in the supine
     position on the fluoroscopy table and the right groin was shaved, prepped, and
     draped in the usual sterile manner. Common femoral artery was identified with
     the aid of fluoroscopic guidance using bony landmarks. 8 cc of 1% lidocaine
     local anesthesia were infiltrated at the site of the right common femoral
     artery and a 19-gauge single wall puncture needle was introduced into the
     right common femoral artery after a small skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made with an #11 blade
     and 0.035"" Bentson guidewire was then advanced through the needle and into the
     lower abdominal aorta. A 5-French sheath was then placed over the wire and its
     side arm was flushed throughout the case with heparinized saline. Over the
     wire, a 5-French marked Omniflush catheter was inserted to the level of L1 and
     abdominal aortogram was performed including AP and lateral views. The catheter
     tip was then withdrawn to the level of the lower abdominal aorta and right and
     left anterior oblique views of the pelvic arteriogram were performed.
     Subsequently, a bilateral femoral arteriogram was performed. The catheter was
     removed. The sheath was removed and adequate hemostasis was achieved with
     manual pressure at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure
     well. No immediate complications were noted.
     
     FINDINGS: The celiac trunk is patent, although mild stenosis of the proximal
     celiac trunk is noted on the lateral view of the aorta. Patent single
     bilateral renal arteries are noted with the left renal artery being lower than
     the right. Distance from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is
     13 cm. The distance from the aortic bifurcation to the right iliac bifurcation

     (Cont)
     is 8 cm.  There is about a 40 degree lateral angulation of the infrarenal
     aorta.  In the lateral view, there is mild posterior angulation of the
     infrarenal aorta.   The right iliac system is more tortuous than the left.
     Bilateral common internal and external iliac arteries are patent. The femoral
     arteries are also widely patent, as are the superficial femoral and profunda
     femoris arteries. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries have diffuse mild
     disease.
     
     IMPRESSION: Aortic aneursym with dimensions as above.
