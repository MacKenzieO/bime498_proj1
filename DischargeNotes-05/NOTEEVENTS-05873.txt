Admission Date:  [**2728-2-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2728-2-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2641-7-1**]       Sex:  F

Service:  TRAUMA SURGICAL

The patient is an 86 year old female transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Doctor First Name **] status post a fall.  CT at that institution
revealed splenic hematoma and question of a splenic
pseudoaneurysm.  The patient with past medical history
significant for congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation
inactive currently, degenerative joint disease, osteoporosis,
hypertension, Paget's disease of bone, depression, blindness,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a previous
fractured clavicle.  The patient has had a cholecystectomy [**46**]
years ago, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy 40 years ago and a left hip fracture.
The patient's work-up in the Trauma Bay revealed a splenic
hematoma and an enhancing lesion with densities, same as
aorta in the area of the hilum of the spleen.  Also noted
were left lower rib fractures and dilated intra and
extrahepatic bile duct.  The patient was admitted to the
Trauma Surgical Service where evaluation of these findings
were undertaken.  The MRA and MRCP of the abdomen, M-D of the
spleen revealed that the splenic lesion was in fact not a
pseudoaneurysm and was just a collection of blood from her
previous fall trauma which has resolved.  MRCP revealed
chronic obstruction of her biliary tree but in the past two
years, based on these findings she remained hemodynamically
stable and will be discharged back to the nursing home.

The patient's discharge is status.  The patient is discharged
to home.

     PELVIS, SINGLE VIEW:  There is increased trabeculation and expansion of the

SICU Nsg Note
     Pt lives at [**Hospital3 1487**] (Nsg Home), and is active, walking with a cane, conversant, usually oriented, occ confused per daughter.  Pt is very HOH and has poor eyesight.  Pt fell at Nsg Home about [**2-18**], to [**Hospital3 1488**] for evaluation, was not admitted.  Fell again on [**2-23**].  Pt has rib fx, bruised L flank, also intermittent abd pain.  Pt to [**Hospital3 1488**] again [**2-25**],CT scan revealed a splenic hematoma, and pseudoanyursem in the spleen.  Pt transfered to [**Hospital1 22**] for interventional radiology - coil embolization of pseudoanyuresm. Pt also has a gall stone in the common bile duct with dilation of duct.  Possible ERCP.
     Pt is 86yo, & daughter does not want pt to have surgery, daughter says that pt would not want surgery either.  Plan is for MRI to further evaluate Pseudoanyuresm of spleen and dilated bowel duct.  Then IR for possible coil embolization will be discussed with pt & daughter based on MRI findings.
A: Hct stable - 37.2 up from 37.0 this am. Rarely c/o abd pain.  Ready to transfer out of ICU.
P: Transfer to CC6, plan for MRI when MRI avialable.

      86 year old woman with intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation on CT scan

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for biliary obstruction
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:
     Status post trauma with possible splenic vascular lesion. Evaluate spleen.
     Evaluate for biliary obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:
     Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the abdomen was performed including
     HAZE, T1 turboflash, nonbreathhold out-of-phase, STIR HASTE, T1 turboflash
     postgadolinium. Multiplanar reconstructions were evaluated on the workstation.
     Correlation is made to a CT scan of the chest dated [**2727-4-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     There has been a slight interval progression in intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation. The common duct is dilated to 1.1 cm and slightly tapers in the
     duodenum with no periampullary mass or filling defect. The patient is status
     post cholecystectomy with dilatation of the cystic duct remnant. There is a
     tiny 2 mm pancreatic cyst. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. There are no
     focal hepatic or pancreatic lesions. The adrenals and kidneys are normal in
     appearance. In the inferior aspect of the spleen, there are two peripheral
     hypointense lesions on the T1 turboflash sequence which may actually connect.
     Postgadolinium sequences demonstrate peripheral enhancement of these lesions
     with no evidence for active extravasation. On the previous CT, a small 5 mm
     lesion was seen. Although the spleen was not imaged in its entirety on the
     previous CT, these lesions are likely new and represent hematomas. There is no
     evidence of vascular injury. No adenopathy or ascites. There is a small left
     pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) New lesions in the interior aspect of the spleen which are compatible with
     hematomas in a patient with a history of trauma. There is no evidence of
     active extravasation or arterial injury.
     
     2) Slight interval increase in intrahepatic biliary dilatation with no
     evidence of a stone or periampullary mass. The etiology of the biliary ductal
     dilatation is not identified on this study. The patient is status post
     cholecystectomy.
