                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST, [**2505-4-14**]:
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma.  Shortness of breath.
     
     A left subclavian central venous catheter remains in place, coursing into the
     inferior aspect of the right atrium.  The heart is upper limits of normal in
     size and stable.  The aorta is slightly unfolded and the pulmonary vascularity
     is normal.  There are multiple surgical clips overlying the right hilum as
     well as additional surgical clips in the periphery of the left upper lobe.
     Areas of pleural and parenchymal scarring are seen at the left upper lobe and
     in the right lung base adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm.  There are also
     scattered irregular predominantly interstitial opacities present in the
     lingula and left lower lobe.  Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is
     also present, and not significantly changed.  No new or progressive
     abnormalities are evident in either lung.
     
     The skeletal structures reveal diffuse demineralization and several
     compression deformities of the spine predominantly in the thoracolumbar
     junction region, without interval change.  Deformity of the 5th left posterior
     rib may be post operative and less likely related to myeloma and is unchanged.
     
     When comparison is made to earlier chest radiographs dating back to [**1-17**], the
     left lower lobe and lingular abnormalities appear new.  The right
     hemidiaphragm also appears less distinct along its medial portion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No significant change since recent CXR of  [**2505-4-10**].  However
     change in appearance compared to February suggests that there is an acute
     process such as multilobar pneumonia (and less likely atypical/asymmetric
     pattern of edema).
     
     Central venous catheter terminates inferiorly within the right atrium.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      man with multiple myeloma and worsening renal insufficiency. R/o obstruction or
      any changes to suggest amyloid 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Multiple myeloma worsening renal function, rule out obstruction
     or any evidence suggestive of amyloidosis.
     
     No comparison studies available.
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The study is limited due to the patient's low lung volumes,
     somewhat high riding kidneys and suboptimal efforts of inspiration.  The right
     kidney measures 11 cm in length. The left kidney measures 10.5 cm in length.
     There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.  Multiple cysts of
     variable sizes are present in both kidneys.  The largest one in the right
     kidney is in the lower pole measuring approximately 5.2 cm in size.  The
     largest one in the left kidney is in the upper pole measuring approximately 3
     cm in size. Both kidneys demonstrate echogenic cortex. Incidental note is made
     of a small right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slightly limited study. No hydronephrosis.  Increased
     echogenicity of the renal cortex, consistent with medical renal disease.
     Amyloidosis cannot be excluded based on this study. Multiple renal cysts
     bilaterally.

     The resting perfusion part of the study was performed with thallium as per
     protocol.  Prior to proceeding with the pharmacologic stress, the referring
     team was contacted the clinical concern of possible pulmonary thromboembolic
     disease as a cause of the patient's symptoms.  The pharmacologic stress
     component of the perfusion study was postponed and then cancelled at the
     referring teams request.

     HISTORY:  CHF, pulmonary hypertension, COPD, status post line placement.
     
     SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW.  The right chest is not included on this view.
     Compared with [**2505-4-28**], a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed.  The tip
     is somewhat underpenetrated, but probably overlies the RV outflow
     tract/proximal main pulmonary artery.  There is scarring and sutures in the
     left lung, with partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of
     the costophrenic angle.  There is moderate-to-moderately severe cardiomegaly.
     There is minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.  The visualized
     portion of the right lung is clear, but the costophrenic angle and lateral
     base are not included.
     
     No pneumothorax is detected.  A left subclavian Port-A-Cath line is present,
     tip overlying right atrium.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Interval placement of right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter.  The patient is rotated
     making precise localization of the lead tip difficult.  I suspect that it
     overlies the RV outflow tract, but if there is clinical concern for
     positioning, then a repeat frontal view obtained without patient rotation
     could help for more precise assessment.
