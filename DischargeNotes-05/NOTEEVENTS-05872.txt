Admission Date:  [**3139-12-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**3139-12-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**3053-1-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 86-year-old Chinese male with
a past medical history significant only of hypertension who
presents with a 2-day history of decreased p.o. intake, the
feeling of cold, and increased thirst but denying any pain.

Beginning in August, the patient developed abdominal cramps,
decreased appetite, intermittent low-grade temperatures,  and
weight loss.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dysphagia, or hematemesis.  In October he was seen in a
doctor's office with a productive cough when a thoracentesis
was done for unknown reason.

A week and a half prior to admission, the patient noted pedal
edema.  The patient also with decreased mobility, walking
with cane due to fatigue and shortness of breath.  He denied
any associated chest pain, lightheadedness, headache, or back
pain.  At the time of admission the patient was without cough
or sick contacts.  No history of pets.  No recent travel.
The patient just emigrated from [**Country **] within the last two
years.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and hard of hearing.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc, Zantac, and Tylenol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol.  The patient was a smoker until
20 years ago.  The patient emigrated from southern [**Country **]
seven years ago.  He lives with his son who still smokes, and
the patient used to be a rice farmer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed afebrile, vital signs were stable.  In
general, Chinese speaking, hard of hearing male, comfortable,
alert.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
extraocular muscles were intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.
The oropharynx was clear.  No lesions.  Cardiovascular
revealed irregularly irregular, a 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur throughout the precordium with radiation to the
axilla.  No third heart sound or fourth heart sound.  Lungs
revealed decreased breath sounds at the bilateral bases; left
greater than right, with associated crackles.  Also, crackles
in the left anterior apex and dullness to percussion
basilarly.  No E to A changes.  The abdomen was mildly
distended, soft, tender to moderate palpation in the right
upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, and epigastrium.  The
liver edge was smooth.  Negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  Occult-blood
negative.  Extremities revealed ankle edema of 2 to 3+.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 4, hematocrit of 33, platelets of 142 (89% polys, no
bands, 7% lymphocytes, 2.6% monocytes, 0.9% eosinophils).
Sodium of 129; and electrolytes were within normal limits.
Coagulations were normal.  Liver function tests revealed ALT
of 39, AST of 83, alkaline phosphatase of 442, amylase of 88,
lipase of 81, total bilirubin of 1.9, LDH of 527, albumin
of 2.7.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed right lower and middle
lobe with interstitial honeycomb pattern, right-sided
mediastinal shift, and a left lower lobe effusion; likely
loculated.

Electrocardiogram showed wondering atrial pacemaker with a
normal axis, small Q wave in I, V5 and V6, right
bundle-branch block, poor R wave progression, and T wave
inversions in V1 and V2.

CT showed no definite mass and left pleural loculated
effusion, question of left lower lobe collapse and
adenopathy, right-sided increase in interstitial markings,
and right pleural thickening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**12-12**], the patient had nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia on the floor and ST elevations was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for acute myocardial
infarction versus pericarditis.  An echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 25% with anterior hypokinesis, and the
patient was started on heparin.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**12-13**]
which showed clean coronaries.  The patient became
hypotensive and tachypneic and required intubation.  On chest
CT a miliary pattern suspicious for tuberculosis was seen
throughout the lungs.  The patient was started on antibiotic
coverage for tuberculosis, per Infectious Disease, on
isoniazid, rifampin, patient-controlled analgesia, and SM
ethambutol.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy as part of his
tuberculosis workup which revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 434**] albicans
pneumonia with necrotic areas throughout the bronchi.  The
patient was also started on intravenous fluconazole.  The
patient also with an episode of DIC, and ultimately sepsis.
The patient was also started on ceftazidime when the patient
was unable to maintain adequate blood pressure.  It was
believed that he was becoming septic.  Unfortunately, the
patient then expired and resuscitation was not attempted
since the patient was do not resuscitate/do not intubate, per
the family's request.

DATE OF EXPIRATION:  [**3139-12-25**].  The family refused
autopsy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 86 y/o man with weight loss, poor PO's, and decreased breath
     sounds at the right base. Evaluate for infiltrate or effusion.
     
     FRONTAL & LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST were obtained. No priors are
     available for comparison.
     
     There is increased density at the left base with a probable loculated pleural
     effusion. Although the patient is slightly rotated, there appears to be shift
     of the heart and mediastinum to the left, suggesting that the left lower lobe
     is at least partially collapsed. The overall heart size is difficult to
     evaluate. The aortic knob is heavily calcified. There is a diffuse
     reticulonodular pattern throughout both lungs which is particularly dense in
     the right lower lobe. There may be a small right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Probable loculated pleural effusion on the left with left lower lobe
     collapse/consolidation. An underlying mass or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     2) Diffuse reticulonodular pattern. This appearance may be related to chronic
     changes such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, in the absence of
     prior CXR for comparison, it may also represent a developing process such as
     atypical infection vs. lymphangitic spread of neoplastic disease.

     INDICATION:  86 y/o man with decreasing O2 saturation.
     
     Portable AP radiograph of the chest dated [**3139-12-11**] at 10:01 am is compared with
     AP and lateral radiographs of the chest dated [**3139-12-10**].
     
     There is a loculated left pleural effusion with associated consolidation/
     collapse which has progressed somewhat in the interval.  The miliary pattern
     throughout the right lung and in the left lung apex is not significantly
     changed although the patchy opacity at the right base has become more
     prominent.  The heart size is difficult to asses in the setting of the left
     effusion.  There is probably a small right pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Progression of left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  Large
     loculated left pleural effusion.  Miliary nodular pattern throughout the right
     lung and left apex and progression of right lower lobe patchy opacity.  These
     findings are suggestive of diffuse infectious process such as tuberculosis.
     However, underlying neoplastic process cannot be excluded.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Cachexia and hypoxia.  Evalaute for lung mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices through the lung bases without IV contrast.  No IV contrast was
     administered secondary to patient's elevated creatinine.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a moderate left-sided pleural
     effusion, which demonstrates a small loculated component anteriorly.  A
     component of the effusion is subpulmonic in location.  There is thickening of
     the pleural surface on the left.  The left lower lobe is partially collapsed,
     and there is resultant shift of the heart and mediastinum to the left.
     
     The heart is within normal limits.  There is a small pericardial effusion. The
     aorta is tortuous and densely calcified at the arch.  Soft tissue windows
     reveal a soft tissue density in the right axilla, which measures 17 mm in
     short axis dimension.  This may represent a pathologically enlarged lymph
     node.  There is also a prominent subcarinal lymph node, which measures 10 mm
     in short axis dimension.
     
     Lung windows reveal a diffuse pattern of interstitial thickening and
     nodularity in the right lung with a predominance in the the right lower lobe
     posteriorly.  There is relative sparing of the right middle lobe and left
     upper lobe, this same septal thickening and micronodular pattern is present in
     the left apex. In addition, there is a small, thick-walled cystic lesion at
     the left apex. There is scarring vs. atelectasis of the left upper lobe
     anteriorly.
     
     The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No definite destructive
     bone lesions are seen.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no gross abnormality of the
     liver or spleen.  There is a tiny high attenuation focus in the left kidney,
     likely representing a small nonobstructing stone. The visualized tail of the
     pancreas is unremarkable.  There is nonspecific increased density in the
     mesentery in the region of the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
                                                                 (Over)

     1. Partial collapse of the left lower lobe with moderate loculated left
     pleural effusion and thickening of the left pleural surface.  No discrete mass
     is identified.
     
     2. Diffuse pattern of reticulonodular opacity throughout the right lung and
     left apex.  This appearance is concerning for an infectious process, such as
     TB, versus a neoplastic process such as lymphangitic spread.  There may also
     be an element of underlying chronic fibrotic change.

     ET tube is 1.75 cm above carina.  Since the previous film of [**3139-12-12**], there
     has been deterioration and there is now total opacification of the left
     hemithorax without obvious shift of heart or mediastinum to either side, and
     this is likely due to a combination of increased pleural effusion and
     associated collapse of left lung.  In addition, on the right side, superadded
     to the previously demonstrated diffuse nodular pattern, there are new areas of
     confluent air space density in the right upper and right lower zones, which
     could be due to superadded pulmonary edema/consolidation; no pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evidence of worsening with  total opacification of the left lung,
     likely due to  new collapse in addition to the  pleural effusion ; no shift of
     heart and mediastinum.  New development of confluent air space opacities in
     the right upper and lower zones ?pulmonary edema versus inflammatory
     consolidation superadded to the  diffuse interstitial pattern.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  An ET tube remains in place currently terminating
     approximately 8.4 cm above the carina.  Central venous catheter and NG tube
     are in satisfactory position.
     
     There remains extensive volume loss in the left hemithorax. A loculated left
     pleural fluid collection is minimally smaller and no pneumothorax is evident.
     A diffuse miliary pattern is seen throughout the lungs, more on the right than
     left.  Patchy superimposed alveolar opacities in right upper and lower lobes
     appear slightly improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Slight reduction in size of loculated left pleural effusion with no
     evidence of pneumothorax.
     2. Diffuse miliary pattern suspicious for tuberculosis.
     3. Superimposed patchy alveolar opacities in right lung are slightly improved.
     4. Proximal location of ET tube terminating slightly greater than 8 cm above
     the carina.

     Chest, single view.
     
     ET tube tip lies in satisfactory position 4.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube
     is present, tip beneath diaphragm off film. A right subclavian central line is
     present, tip in proximal SVC. Allowing for differences in positioning, the
     pulmonary findings are unchanged. Again seen is a left pleural effusion,
     possibly loculated, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Also again
     seen is a fine reticular increased interstitial pattern in the right lung,
     more pronounced at the right base peripherally. No right sided effusion. Doubt
     overt CHF. Patient rotation makes it difficult to assess for left sided volume
     loss, but I doubt interval change. Probable slight loss of height of several
     mid thoracic vertebral bodies.

      86 year old man with miliary TB, palpable abdominal mass, rising bilirubin,
      diffuse lymphadenopathy
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      R/o retroperitoneal bleed, abdominal mass, evaluate bowel for possible
      obstruction

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  86 year old male with TB, palpable abdominal mass, rising
     bilirubin, diffuse lymphadenopathy.  Rule out retroperitoneal bleed, abdominal
     mass, evaluate for possible obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
     the symphysis pubis after administration of 100 cc of Optiray.  Nonionic
     contrast used secondary to elevated creatinine.  Multiple reformations were
     performed.
     
     COMPARISONS:  [**3139-12-11**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a stable appearance of the moderate left
     sided pleural effusion with a small loculated component.  There is pleural
     thickening on the left which is not significantly changed. A new right sided
     effusion is present.  The reticular nodular pattern at the right base appears
     slightly worse on the current exam.  An endotracheal tube has been placed in
     the interval.  The heart and great vessels appear normal.  There is no
     mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are multiple small foci of low attenuation
     within the liver and spleen.  These are too small to further characterize but
     likely represent simple cysts.  The liver and spleen are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals appear normal.  There
     are multiple simple cysts within both kidneys.  No mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal adenopathy is appreciated.  There has been interval
     development of ascites throughout the abdomen.  The fluid has low attenuation
     and is characteristic of simple fluid and not blood.  No free air is
     identified within the abdomen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is fluid tracking into the pelvis which is of
     low attenuation and characteristic of simple fluid.  The opacified loops of
     large and small bowel appear unremarkable.  The distal ureters and bladder
     appear normal.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
     
     Bone windows demonstrates a compression fracture of the vertebral body of L3.
     The above findings were confirmed with multiple reformations.
