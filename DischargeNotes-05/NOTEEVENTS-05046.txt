     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      51 year old woman with 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**3360-10-24**].
     
     INDICATION:  Patient with a history of pancreatitis and ascites.
     
     COMPARISON:  Correlation is made to prior CT examinations of [**3360-9-24**] and
     [**3359-11-7**].  Comparison is made to ultrasound examination of [**3359-11-21**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is heterogeneous in echotexture.  No focal liver lesions
     are identified.  There is central biliary dilatation and  common bile duct
     dilitation with a  maximal diameter of 1.5 cm.  There is a dilated pancreatic
     duct, which measures 6 mm.  This was identified on the most recent prior CT
     examination. In addition, in the vicinity of the distal common bile duct,
     there is a 9-mm echogenic calcification.  The location of this calcification
     is compared to the prior CT examination of [**3359-11-7**], and it is a new finding.
     Its appearance on the current ultrasound examination is suspicious for a
     distal common bile duct stone.  Color Doppler and spectral Doppler evaluation
     demonstrates that the main portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow.
     The pancreas is slightly edematous but no peripancreatic fluid collections are
     identified. The gallbladder is unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of
     ascites in the pelvis.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     1) There is a 9-mm calcification near the region of the distal common bile
     duct; its appearance on ultrasound suggests that it actually resides within
     the distal common bile duct.  There is central biliary, common bile duct and
     pancreatic duct dilatation.
     
     2) No peripancreatic fluid collections are seen.  Portal vein is patent with
     normal hepatopetal flow.
     
     3) Heterogeneous liver.  No focal liver lesions identified.

Admission Date:  [**3360-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**3360-10-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**3309-9-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  SURGERY GOLD

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This was a 51-year-old female
with a history of alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and
cirrhosis, status post gastrojejunostomy secondary to
duodenal stricture with a past medical history of diabetes
mellitus, intermittent exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis,
and osteoporosis.

The patient was admitted on [**3360-10-27**], and presented
with the presumptive diagnosis of choledocholithiasis,
metabolic alkalosis, sudden onset, which was thought to be
secondary to decompensated liver failure.  She was admitted
to the [**Company **] Medicine Service where she was cared for initially
on the floor and evaluated by the Liver Service as well.  On
[**3360-10-28**], the patient received a CT scan which
demonstrated a probable small bowel obstruction.  Given her
continued decompensation, it was thought to be a combination
of hepatic encephalopathy, worsening ..................
status.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on the East Campus.  On [**10-28**], a Surgery
consult was obtained.

On review of the [**Hospital 1032**] hospital course, it was noted that
there was a question of small bowel obstruction per CT scan;
however, given the patient met criteria for Child C
cirrhosis, was a very poor surgical candidate.  A series of
discussions were undertaken with the family as to whether or
not they wished to pursue surgical correction of the small
bowel obstruction.  It was decided by the family they would
pursue this option, and on the evening of [**3360-10-29**],
the patient was taken to the Operating Room by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she underwent exploratory laparotomy.

At the time, it was noted that the patient had a thick
adhesion upon which there was a lobulized loop of jejunum.
An approximate 10 cm segment of the jejunum was resected.
The patient tolerated this procedure.  She was transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the East Campus.

Over night from [**10-29**], until the evening of [**10-30**], the patient was noted to be increasingly alkalotic
despite supportive care measures by the Intensive Care Unit
staff.  It was decided, with the patient becoming
progressively more obtunded, her abdomen more distended,
difficulties managing her blood pressure, and acid based
status, to return with the patient to the Operating Room on
the evening of [**3360-10-30**].

At that time, the patient underwent a second exploratory
laparotomy where she was noted to have a large amount of
peritoneal fluid which was evacuated by suction.  At that
time, exploratory laparotomy, there was evidence of diffuse
ischemic and infarctive disease of the small bowel.  At that
time, it was decided to close the patient and return her to
the Intensive Care Unit.

Discussions with the family where undertaken, and it was
decided at that time to withdraw support and make the patient
COMFORT CARE MEASURES ONLY.  The patient was taken off
pressors and intravenous fluids in the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  She was bolused with Dilaudid.  Approximately 45
min after withdraw of support, the patient expired.
Following this, the family declined a postmortem examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Demise secondary to cardiac arrest in
the setting of septic shock and small bowel obstruction.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Obstruction vs. ileus on KUB.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis using 150 cc of IV optiray contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
     were performed for further evaluation.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation and prominence of the CBD followed to the head of the pancreas. The
     pancreatic duct is also prominent, measuring 5 mm.  There is moderate ascites
     throughout the abdomen.  There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel with
     multiple air fluid levels.  No clear transition point is identified, but it is
     probably located within the distal third of the small bowel in the right
     abdomen.  There is a loop of small bowel within the left mid abdomen which
     demonstrates wall thickening.  There are multiple low attenuation lesions
     within both kidneys, most of which are too small to characterize, but there is
     a 1.7 cm simple right renal cyst.  The spleen, adrenal glands appear normal.
     The pancreas is markedly atrophic.  There is no retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple dilated loops of small
     bowel extending into the pelvis.  Ascites tracks into the pelvis.  There is no
     lymphadenopathy.  A Foley catheter and air is present within the bladder.
     
     A dynamic compression screw traverses the left femoral neck and there is
     cortical irregularity related to an old fracture.  Otherwise, osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with multiple air fluid levels
     suggest an evolving obstruction with no definite transition point identified.
     However, the transition point probably is present within the distal third of
     the small bowel in the right abdomen.
     2)  Moderate ascites.
     3) Prominent pancreatic and intrahepatic biliary ducts.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST AP:
     
     INDICATION:  Cirrhosis with altered mental status.  Evaluate position of Swan-
     Ganz catheter and central venous line.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3360-10-29**] at 10:00 hours.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is opacification at the left base with obliteration of the
     left costophrenic angle.  There is also slight blunting at the right
     costophrenic angle.  The lungs are otherwise clear.
     
     The position of the NG and ET tubes are unchanged since the prior examination.
     There has been interval placement of what appears to be a Swan-Ganz catheter.
     The distal third of the catheter is looped in the IVC with the tip probably
     within the right atrium.  I do not see a central venous catheter.  No
     pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Position of lines as described.  Bilateral pleural effusions more
     marked on the left.

     INDICATION: Cirrhosis, choledocholithiasis, change in mental status s/p
     intubation, r/o pneumothorax and assess ETT position.
     
     SINGLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH dated [**3360-10-29**] at 10 a.m. is compared with
     prior chest radiograph obtained 6 hours earlier. There is no interval change
     in position of the NG tube. The ETT is intervally placed, terminating
     approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     There is no significant interval change in the appearance of the chest since
     the prior study. Note is again made of large amount of air in the left upper
     quadrant with haustration.
     
     IMPRESSION: ETT in good position. No interval change in the appearance of the
     chest.
     
     Probable colonic air in the left upper quadrant. However, if there is any
     clinical suspicion for free intra-abdominal air, a left sided down decubitus
     view can be performed for better evaluation of presence of pneumoperitoneum.

     INDICATION: Rule out bleeding.
     
     COMMENT: Portable supine AP radiograph of the abdomen is reviewed. The tip of
     the nasogastric tube is identified in the gastric fundus. Again note is made
     of multiple loops of dilated small bowel, which is indicating small bowel
     obstruction. There is relative paucity of the air throughout the colon. Large
     amount of food is seen in the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION: Probable small bowel obstruction.

     INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, choledocholithiasis, change in mental status. Evaluate
     for CHF and free air.
     
     Single frontal chest radiograph is compared to prior dated [**3360-10-28**].
     
     There is no significant interval change in the appearance of the chest.  There
     is no evidence of CHF.
     
     The NG tube has been advanced, terminating in the gastric fundus.
     
     A large amount of air is noted in the left upper quadrant, which appears to
     contain haustration and therefore probably represents intracolonic air.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of CHF.  Probable colonic air in the left upper
     quadrant.  However, if there is clinical suspicion for free intra-abdominal
     air, a left-side down, right-side up decubitus view can be performed for a
     more sensitive evaluation for the presence of pneumoperitoneum.
