     CHEST PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW:
     
     INDICATION:  Placement of biventricular ICD via left subclavian vein. Evaluate
     position, rule out complication.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in upright
     position demonstrates the placement of a permanent pacer in left anterior
     axillary portion connected to two electrodes.  The one which terminates in the
     apical portion of the right ventricle has two areas of enforcement
     corresponding to the stanby defibrillator electrodes.  The second wire curves
     in the ordinary fashion in the right atrium to terminate in location
     compatible with right atrial appendage.  A third thin wire electrode can be
     identified but is difficult to see in its intracardiac portion.
     A SMALL METALLIC TIP ENFORCEMENT IS SEEN TO VERLY THE CARDIAC SHADOW
     suggesting that this wire terminates in a left lateral obtuse marginal
     coronary vein. PA and lateral view documentation, however, is recommended.

CXR: mild fluffy opacities consistent with pulmonary edema  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] is an 80 year old man with c.difficile pancolitis, in 
the setting of recent levofloxacin use. He also presented a 
troponin leak from likely demand ischemia. Recently, he had a 
normal TSH ruling out hyperthyroidism as an etiology and a 
virtual colonoscopy that showed no colonic lesions though there 
was poor visualization of the descending colon and no 
intraabdominal masses or other pathology. 

1. C. diff pancolitis

In terms of his colitis, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6661**] stool was negative for 
toxin A on several occasional but positive for c.difficile toxin 
B. He had multiple bowel movements per day, usually OB positive, 
and he even had an episode of melena. He was made NPO and 
started on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl in additional to morphine 
and tylenol for pain. He was followed by surgery and GI but it 
was felt that there were no indications for intervention since 
he's a poor surgical candidate and colonoscopy could potentially 
perforate the colon. 

He continued to improve with diarrhea resolving.  He remained on 
po vancomycin for this infection. He will complete a course of 
po vancomycin for about two months in 
total.

2. VRE UTI/Bacteremia

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] made progress in his recovery until he spiked a 
fever. His blood cultures grew 4/4 bottles of VRE on [**1-21**] and 
4/4 bottles on [**1-22**]; he was started on linezolid. He appears to 
have seeded his blood from his urine where his urine culture 
grew out 10,000 colonies of VRE [**1-16**]. His PICC was pulled. He 
had a TTE to r/o evidence of endocarditis.  Of note, he had an 
AICD placed in 1/05.  THe TTE did not show any evidence of 
endocarditis.  He then underwent a TEE which showed no evidence 
of endocarditis.

- An initial CT abd/pelvis on admission raised the possibility 
of intravesical air as a sign of entero-vesical fistula (which 
might explain the VRE uti and subsequent bacteremia
- A f/u CT abd/pelvis was done with rectal contrast to evaluate 
for this possibility. While the rectal contrast did not reach 
high enough to directly visualize a potential fistula, there was 
no evidence of intra-vesical air on this study, making a fistula 
less likely. 

*** will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in ID 
- plan 4 weeks of po linezolid 600 BID (start date of 2/26 - 
first date of negative cultures)
- f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2-19**] at 9:30 AM
- will f/u with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after d/c

*** will need f/u TEE.

*** will need weekly CBC to follow for cytopenias with linezolid 
therapy.

3. Chronic renal insufficiency:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] has chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline 
1.7-2.0. He was initially thought to be prerenal from CHF 
combined with contrast induced ARF. Within 3 days of admission, 
he became oliguric and hypotensive. He was sent to the MICU 
where he was fluid resuscitated with 8 liters. His hypotension, 
oliguria, and acute renal failure resolved within a few days. He 
was transferred back to the floor, where he was effectively 
diuresed without precipitating a rise in creatinine. 
Creatinine on discharge was 1.5; lasix and ACE-I were held on 
account of 
bump in crn from 1.2 to 1.5

4. Troponin leak:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] had a troponin leak which was thought to be secondary 
to congestive heart failure. He has an EF of < 20%, and was 
initially started ASA, with continuation of his statin. His 
Lisinopril and metoprolol were initially discontinued, as he was 
hypotensive. They were both restarted once he stabilized.

5. Urinary retention:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] has urinary retention.  Once his foley was pulled, he 
was able to urinate. The Tamsulosin was continued. 

6. Hypothyroidism:

For his hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine was continued. 

7. COPD:

For his COPD, he was continued on 
albuterol/ipratropium/fluticasone MDIs in addition to nebulizer 
treatments. He no longer required oxygen by the end of his stay.

8. Oral candidiasis:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6659**] had oral candidiasis in addition to urinary [**Female First Name (un) **]. 
He was treated with one dose of fluconazole and nystatin swish 
and swallow.

     INDICATION:  Patient with bilateral lower quadrant pain, bloody diarrhea.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT acquisitions of the abdomen and pelvis were
     acquired after administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  This study is compared to examination from [**3153-12-2**].
     
     REPORT:  CT of lung bases shows a dual pacemaker wire. Mild enlargement of the
     right atrium is seen.  There is a nonspecific inflammatory change at the left
     base, and a left-sided pleural effusion is seen.  In addition, there are
     centrilobular emphysematous changes.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.  Multiple lesions are identified within the liver.  A
     lesion in segment 3 measures 3 x 2.5 cm and has morphologic features of a
     simple cyst.  A further lesion in segment 7 measure 8 mm and also appears like
     a simple cyst.  A further lesion in segment 5, also resembling a simple cyst,
     measures 3.4 x 2.5 cm.  A small trace of ascites surrounding the liver is
     seen.  The gallbladder appears relatively normal.  In the dependent portion is
     identified a small linear calcification that likely represents a small
     gallstone.
     
     Normal spleen.
     
     The pancreas is atrophic but otherwise appears normal.
     
     There is diffuse abnormality involving the colon, particularly involving the
     distal colon from the level of the splenic flexure to the rectum and also the
     proximal colon, particularly surrounding the cecum and ascending colon.  There
     is relative preservation of the transverse colon.  The findings show diffuse

     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.  There is a small amount of air within the bladder.
     In the absence of recent history of catheterization, this is suspicious for
     fistulization from the adjacent bowel.  The bladder is intimately related to
     the sigmoid colon which is markedly abnormal.  Multiple diverticula are
     identified in this region.
     
     There is extensive atheroma involving the descending aorta and the major
     visceral arteries and trunks.  Circumferential mural calcification is
     identified in many arteries.  This particularly involves the origin of the
     superior mesenteric artery and because of the circumferential thickening, it
     is difficult to exclude focal thrombus in parts.  However the visualized parts
     of the SMA appear patent, the SMV is definitely patent while the celiac artery
     is also similarly diseased, the hepatic artery and splenic artery appear
     normal.
     
     Degenerative disease is seen in the right hip, where there is subchondral cyst
     formation, minor eburnation and osteophyte formation.  There has been a left-
     sided hip replacement.  Multilevel degenerative disease including facet joints
     is also seen.  No overtly suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     
     The findings favor a diagnosis of pancolitis, and in this context, C.
     difficile is considered the most likely diagnosis.  While there is evidence of
     diverticular disease, the findings are too widespread for this to be the
     primary etiology.  The changes are not confined to the watershed areas and in
     the absence of a history to suggest global hypoperfusion, this is thought to
     be less likely.

     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT acquisitions of the abdomen and pelvis were
     acquired after administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
     
     COMPARISON:  This study is compared to examination from [**3153-12-2**].
     
     REPORT:  CT of lung bases shows a dual pacemaker wire. Mild enlargement of the
     right atrium is seen.  There is a nonspecific inflammatory change at the left
     base, and a left-sided pleural effusion is seen.  In addition, there are
     centrilobular emphysematous changes.
     
     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.  Multiple lesions are identified within the liver.  A
     lesion in segment 3 measures 3 x 2.5 cm and has morphologic features of a
     simple cyst.  A further lesion in segment 7 measure 8 mm and also appears like
     a simple cyst.  A further lesion in segment 5, also resembling a simple cyst,
     measures 3.4 x 2.5 cm.  A small trace of ascites surrounding the liver is
     seen.  The gallbladder appears relatively normal.  In the dependent portion is

     INDICATION:  Hypoxia and crackles, evaluate for CHF.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient in upright sitting
     position and is analyzed in direct comparison with a similar examination dated
     [**3153-12-31**].  A permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position
     connected to a dual intracavitary electrode system appears in unchanged
     position.  A third wire with termination point compatible with central portion
     of left obtuse marginal coronary vein is noted and apparently achieves
     biventricular pacing.  In comparison with the previous study, the heart size
     remains unchanged and demonstrates a prominence of the left ventricular
     contour to the left.  The pulmonary vasculature does not show any increased
     congestive pattern in comparison with the previous study.  Some linear density
     in the retrocardiac area suggests peripheral plate atelectasis, but no
     evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates is present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Stable appearance of chest.  No evidence of newly developed CHF.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  History of coronary artery disease, CHF, and pancolitis; now,
     with anuria.  Evaluate for obstruction.
     
     COMPARISON:  Prior CT scan from [**3153-12-30**].
     
     RENAL ULTRASOUND:  The right kidney measures 10.0 cm, and the left kidney
     measures 9.6 cm.  No hydronephrosis, stones, or mass.  A small, rounded hypo-
     echoic structure is seen arising off the right kidney, which likely represents
     a renal cyst, measuring 13.5 mm.  There is increased echogenicity of the
     kidneys bilaterally.  A small amount of free fluid is noted in [**Location (un) 966**]
     pouch. The visualized portion of the liver is normal without any focal or
     textural abnormality.  In the left upper quadrant, the bowel overlying the
     left kidney appears slightly abnormal with the suggestion of bowel wall
     thickening, consistent with patient's known history of pancolitis.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction. Increased

     HISTORY:  An 80-year-old man requiring double-lumen PICC for long-term TPN.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 329**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 156**]
     (the Attending Radiologist) who was present and supervising throughout.  The
     patient was placed in supine position and his right upper arm was prepped and
     draped in the standard sterile fashion.  After infusion of 1% Lidocaine, the
     right brachial vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle under ultrasonographic
     guidance.  An 018 wire was advanced into the SVC using flouroscopic guidance.
     Based on the markers on the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 35
     cm would be appropriate for the dual- lumen PICC.  The PICC was cut and
     advanced over a 5- French Introducer sheath. The wire and sheath were removed.
     The line was flushed and hep-locked and secured with a Stat-Lock.  Final chest
     image demonstrated appropriate positioning of the PICC tip in the SVC.  The
     patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no images post-procedure
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a right, 35 cm total length, dual-lumen
     PICC via brachial vein access with the tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for

     Liver appears normal, but again contains at least two large discrete lesions
     likely representing cysts.  The gallbladder is not distended, but contains a
     small amount of pericholecystic fluid.  There is generalized anasarca present

     likely represent hypoproteinemia , but should be corrrelation with
     clinical symptoms should be performed, and if these present, ultrasound should
     be used to rule out cholecystitis. A small gallstone is seen.  There is no
     intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Pancreatic atrophy is seen,
     but no discrete pancreatic lesion is seen.  Normal spleen.
     
     CT PELVIS:  Normal kidneys.  The ureters excrete contrast bilaterally.
     
     A left-sided total hip replacement is in situ.
     
     There is evidence again of marked diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon.
     Unfortunately, the rectal contrast does not pass this area, so a direct
     fistula of the bladder cannot be excluded.  However, there is no remaining
     intravesical air making this less likely.  Small amount of contrast within the
     base of the bladder likely comes from the ureters.  There has been marked
     improvement in the amount of colitis, and apart from the significant

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80-year-old male with chest pain.   
      
     SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  Dipyridamole was infused
     intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg per minute.  Two minutes 
     after the cessation of infusion, Tc-99m sestamibi was administered IV. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Imaging protocol:  Gated SPECT. 
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.  Tracer was injected 15 
     minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. 
      
     Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged with stress and rest. 
     Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
     myocardium. 
      
     Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.  The calculated LV ejection fraction is
     14%. 
      
     There are no significant changes in myocardial perfusion as compared to prior
     Persantine MIBI dated [**3153-2-17**]. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1.  Normal myocardial perfusion.  2.  LV enlargement, global
     hypokinesis and EF of 14%, consistent with cardiomyopathy.

     INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to his back between the shoulders, history
     of CAD, CHF, and COPD.
     
     COMPARISON:  No chest CT is available for comparison.  CT abdomen and pelvis
     dated [**3154-1-29**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the chest were obtained before and after
     the administration of IV contrast.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of dissection.  There
     are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated
     compressive atelectasis.  There are scattered bilateral areas of ground-glass
     opacity, most prominent in the left upper lobe.  There is thickening of the
     interlobular septa.  There is a 14 mm right paratracheal and a 12 mm right
     paratracheal lymph node (short axis diameter).  There are multiple other
     smaller mediastinal lymph nodes including small prevascular nodes, precarinal
     nodes, and hilar nodes.  There is cardiac enlargement.  A dual lead pacemaker
     device is in place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle and
     third lead present in the coronary sinus.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease
     is again demonstrated with calcification of the aorta and coronary arteries.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a 2.7 x 3.5 cm well-defined low-density
     lesion in the left lobe of the liver and a 3.1 x 3.8 cm well-defined low-
     density lesion in the right lobe of the liver consistent with cysts.  Small
     calcified gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.  The spleen, pancreas,
     adrenal glands, and kidneys are grossly unremarkable.  There are no
     pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes by CT
     criteria.  There is slight diffuse mesenteric stranding, a nonspecific sign.
     There is no intra-abdominal free air.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are multiple sclerotic foci located in the axial
     skeleton, notably T7, T10, T11, T12, L2, L5, and both iliac bones.  The
     sclerotic foci in T7, T10, T12, and L2 are new compared to the exam of [**3153-3-2**].
     There are two sclerotic foci in T11, one of which is new compared to the exam
     of [**3153-3-2**], and one of which is larger compared to that exam.  The sclerotic
     foci in the lower thoracic, and lumbar spines and iliac bones are also present
     on the more recent exam dated [**3154-1-29**], some of which now appear larger on the
     current exam . There are sclerotic foci of the right 9th rib laterally and the
                                                                 (Over)

     2)  Bilateral pleural effusions with patchy areas of ground-glass opacity,
     most prominent in the left upper lobe and interlobular septal thickening
     consistent with CHF/volume overload.
     3)  Paratracheal lymphadenopathy.
     4)  Stable, likely liver cysts.
     5)  Multiple sclerotic foci of the axial skeleton, most of which are new
     compared to the exam of [**3153-3-2**], worrisome for metastatic disease.  A primary
     tumor such as prostate is associated with blastic metastasis.  Clinical
     correlation and correlation with patient's history is recommended.

     INDICATION:  80-year-old with chest pain radiating to the back.  Rule out
     pneumonia.  Dissection also in the differential.
     
     SINGLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to [**3154-3-25**].  Left-sided pacer with its tips
     unchanged in position.  The heart is enlarged but stable compared to the prior
     study.  There is blunting of the right CP angle, and left basilar
     opacification.  Pulmonary vasculature centrally is somewhat prominent, though
     there is no evidence of acute congestive heart failure.  The aortic arch
     contour is unremarkable; however, chest x-ray is not sensitive to assess for
     dissection.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Stable cardiomegaly.  Probable opacification in the left base in
     a retrocardiac position.  Dedicated PA and lateral could be obtained to
     confirm this.  Small right-sided pleural effusion/thickening.  Normal aortic
     arch contour; however, chest x-ray is not sensitive to evaluate for
     dissection.  If clinical suspicion remains high, dedicated CTA is recommended.

     HISTORY:  80-year-old man with bone pain, elevated PSA and sclerotic bone foci,
     which are increasing in size in the past 3 months.  Evaluate for metastatic   
     prostate cancer.
     
     DECISION:  Additional SPECT views of the lower lumbar spine were obtained for
     better delineation of abnormal tracer uptake seen in this area.  Planar views of
     the skull in the anterior and posterior projections were also performed.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton, SPECT images of the lumbar
     spine and planar images of the skull show abnormal tracer activity within a
     linear pattern in the anterior right approximately 5th rib, consistent with
     metastatic disease.  There is abnormal tracer uptake within the approximately
     T12, L2, and left sides of the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies, compatible with
     metastatic disease.  There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity
     within the left iliac bone and two foci within the right iliac bone.   There is
     irregular tracer activity within the sternoclavicular joints bilaterally, more
     likely degenerative.
     
     The above described findings are consistent with metastatic disease and
     correlate with the sclerotic lesions seen on the CT scan from [**3154-4-11**].
     
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer

     INDICATION:  Evaluate ground glass opacities on CT with leukocytosis. Evaluate
     for pneumonia.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained, compared with the
     chest x-ray as well as a CT performed yesterday.
     
     FINDINGS:  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette remain similarly enlarged.  On
     yesterday's CT, there was no evidence of consolidation, with combination of
     atelectasis and effusion. Today, there may be slight increased retrocardiac
     opacity. There is a small to moderate left- sided pleural effusion.
     
     Left-sided cardiac pacemaker is unchanged.  No other pulmonary opacities are
     appreciated.  There is increased interstitial prominence and perihilar
     haziness, suggesting worsening of congestive failure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight worsening of congestive failure since yesterday.  There is
     increased pleural effusion and atelectasis, probably accounts for the slightly
     increased retrocardiac opacity, although infection cannot be excluded.

     quadrant pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is slightly irregular in echogenicity, with no obvious
     focal lesions, except for two cysts measuring up to 3.3 cm.  The IVC and
     hepatic veins are dilated, in keeping with congestive heart failure.  There
     are a few small gallstones.  The gallbladder is not dilated, but the wall is
     slightly thickened, most probably also secondary to third spacing of
     congestive heart failure.  There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary
     dilatation.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  The spleen is not enlarged.  The
     kidneys are normal with no evidence of hydronephrosis, the right kidney
     measures 9.5 cm and the left kidney measures 9 cm.  There are bilateral small
     non-obstructing caliceal stones.  There is a small amount of ascites.  There
     is bilateral pleural effusion, small on the right and slightly more prominent
     on the left.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Some gallstones with slight gallbladder wall thickening,  most probably due to
     third spacing.
     Bilateral pleural effusion and trace ascites.

     CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE
     
     INDICATION:  History of metastatic prostate cancer, presents with fecal
     incontinence, decreased rectal tone.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**1-29**], 2005.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the lumbar spine was performed
     without administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformations were also performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are numerous densely sclerotic lesions throughout the
     visualized skeleton consistent with the patient's known history of metastatic
     prostate cancer.  The largest of these lesions is demonstrated within the
     posterior and superior aspect of the L2 vertebral body.  These lesions are
     more conspicuous and increased in size compared to the prior CT of the abdomen
     from [**3154-1-26**].  None of these lesions, however, appear to disrupt or cause
     extension beyond the confines of the cortex.  In particular, none of these
     lesions appears to extend within the spinal canal.  No acute fractures are
     identified.  The vertebral body heights appear preserved.  The alignment is
     within normal limits.
     
     There are multilevel degenerative changes.  In particular, at L2-3, there is a
     large intraosseous disc protrusion anteriorly into the L2 vertebral body
     consistent with a Schmorl's node which is noted to contain gas.  There is also
     a broad-based disc bulge, which indents upon the thecal sac but does not
     appear to cause significant canal compromise.
     
     At L3-4, there is a broad-based disc bulge.  Combined with degenerative
     changes in the facet joints and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, there is
     moderately severe narrowing of the canal at this level.  Fat density appears
     preserved in the neural foramen bilaterally.  A large Schmorl's node is also
     noted protruding into the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.
     
     At L4-5, there is also a broad-based disc bulge, which combined with
     degenerative changes in the facets and thickening of the ligamentum flavum
     causes moderately severe canal narrowing at this level.  Fat density also
     appears preserved in the neural foramen surrounding the exiting nerve roots.
                                                                 (Over)

     Comparison to the prior CT is difficult due to differences in technique, with
     note that some of these degenerative changes appear to have been present on
     the prior study, though it is difficult to exclude worsening of these
     degenerative changes.
     
     There is again demonstrated extensive vascular calcification in the visualized
     abdominal and pelvic arteries.  Partially visualized low-attenuation lesions
     in the left lobe of liver are also noted, consistent with the previously
     imaged cysts.  Bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  The above findings were confirmed with multiplanar
     reconstructions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse sclerotic bony metastases consistent with patient's known history
     of metastatic prostate cancer.  These metastatic lesions appear to have
     progressed compared to the prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis, though do not
     appear to extend or invade into the spinal canal.
     2.  Moderately severe spinal stenoses at L3-4 and L4-5, which appear secondary
     to degenerative changes and broad-based disc bulges as discussed above.

     CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE
     
     INDICATION:  History of metastatic prostate cancer, presents with fecal
     incontinence, decreased rectal tone.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**1-29**], 2005.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning of the lumbar spine was performed
     without administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
     reformations were also performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  There are numerous densely sclerotic lesions throughout the
     visualized skeleton consistent with the patient's known history of metastatic
     prostate cancer.  The largest of these lesions is demonstrated within the
     posterior and superior aspect of the L2 vertebral body.  These lesions are
     more conspicuous and increased in size compared to the prior CT of the abdomen
     from [**3154-1-26**].  None of these lesions, however, appear to disrupt or cause
     extension beyond the confines of the cortex.  In particular, none of these
     lesions appears to extend within the spinal canal.  No acute fractures are
     identified.  The vertebral body heights appear preserved.  The alignment is
     within normal limits.
     
     There are multilevel degenerative changes.  In particular, at L2-3, there is a
     large intraosseous disc protrusion anteriorly into the L2 vertebral body
     consistent with a Schmorl's node which is noted to contain gas.  There is also
     a broad-based disc bulge, which indents upon the thecal sac but does not
     appear to cause significant canal compromise.
     
     At L3-4, there is a broad-based disc bulge.  Combined with degenerative
     changes in the facet joints and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, there is
     moderately severe narrowing of the canal at this level.  Fat density appears
     preserved in the neural foramen bilaterally.  A large Schmorl's node is also
     noted protruding into the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body.
     
     At L4-5, there is also a broad-based disc bulge, which combined with
     degenerative changes in the facets and thickening of the ligamentum flavum
     causes moderately severe canal narrowing at this level.  Fat density also
     appears preserved in the neural foramen surrounding the exiting nerve roots.
                                                                 (Over)

     noted.  Overall, there has not been a significant interval improvement
     allowing for technical differences between the examinations, with findings
     most suggestive of congestive heart failure with associated pulmonary edema.
     
     Note is also made of an asymmetrical opacity at the right first costochondral

     Comparison is made to previous portable radiograph of earlier the same date as
     well as CTA of the chest dated [**3154-4-11**].  PA and lateral chest radiograph
     of [**3154-4-12**], is also compared.
     
     The asymmetrical density at the right first costochondral junction is shown to
     represent prominent asymmetrical degenerative changes at this level on the CTA

     HISTORY:  81-year-old man with prostate cancer, metastasis, and pelvic pain.
     Evaluate for fractures from metastasis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
     without contrast.  Reformatted images of the pelvis were obtained.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3154-1-29**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN:  Atelectatic changes and scarring are noted at the lung bases.
     Pleural effusion have resolved.  Two large low-attenuation foci are again
     noted in the liver and have the appearance of cysts.  However, they have both
     increased in size compared to prior exam.  There is an additional right
     lateral low attenuation hepatic focus, which is also cystic in appearance but
     was not present on prior exam. The liver is diffusely increased in attenuation
     on this non-contrast study. Small stones are noted within the gallbladder. The
     pancreas is atrophic.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Adrenal glands are within
     normal limits.  Linear calcifications are seen in both kidneys and likely
     vascular in origin. However, there are more rounded calcifications in the
     right, mid, and lower pole and may represent calculi.  The stomach and bowel
     loops are within normal limits.  There is no free air or free fluid.  No
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.  There are
     extensive vascular calcifications.
     
     CT PELVIS:  The bladder and prostate are stable in appearance.  Sigmoid
     diverticula are observed without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is no free
     fluid, and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Compared to the exam of [**3154-1-29**], the sclerotic lesions of
     T11-12, L2, L5, both iliac bones, and the right medial acetabulum are
     increased in size.  No pathologic fractures are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pathologic fractures identified.  Interval increase in size of
     sclerotic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine and pelvis consistent with
     progression of metastatic disease.
     2.  Increase in size of two cystic hepatic foci.  Interval development of an
     additional cystic focus.
     3.  Increased attenuation of the liver on this non-contrast study, which could
     be related to amiodarone toxicity.
     4.  Small rounded calcific densities in the right kidney could represent
     vascular calcifications; however, small renal calculi cannot be excluded.
     5.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

     Pleural effusion have resolved.  Two large low-attenuation foci are again
     noted in the liver and have the appearance of cysts.  However, they have both
     increased in size compared to prior exam.  There is an additional right
     lateral low attenuation hepatic focus, which is also cystic in appearance but
     was not present on prior exam. The liver is diffusely increased in attenuation
     on this non-contrast study. Small stones are noted within the gallbladder. The
     pancreas is atrophic.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Adrenal glands are within
     normal limits.  Linear calcifications are seen in both kidneys and likely
     vascular in origin. However, there are more rounded calcifications in the
     right, mid, and lower pole and may represent calculi.  The stomach and bowel
     loops are within normal limits.  There is no free air or free fluid.  No
     mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.  There are
     extensive vascular calcifications.
     
     CT PELVIS:  The bladder and prostate are stable in appearance.  Sigmoid
     diverticula are observed without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is no free
     fluid, and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Compared to the exam of [**3154-1-29**], the sclerotic lesions of
     T11-12, L2, L5, both iliac bones, and the right medial acetabulum are
     increased in size.  No pathologic fractures are identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No pathologic fractures identified.  Interval increase in size of
     sclerotic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine and pelvis consistent with
     progression of metastatic disease.
     2.  Increase in size of two cystic hepatic foci.  Interval development of an
     additional cystic focus.
     3.  Increased attenuation of the liver on this non-contrast study, which could
     be related to amiodarone toxicity.
     4.  Small rounded calcific densities in the right kidney could represent
     vascular calcifications; however, small renal calculi cannot be excluded.
     5.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
     
     
     
                                                                 (Over)
