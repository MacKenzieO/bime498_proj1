Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 306**] 
Chief Complaint:
Tracheomalacia 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2623-5-23**]: had rigid bronch, electrocautery and balloon dilatation 
of trachea, and upsizing of her trach to a #7
[**2623-6-2**]: rigid bronch, T-tube placement
L-PICC placement 
 
History of Present Illness:
Txfer from [**Hospital3 **]  
In 1/06, patient was difficult to extubate s/p CABG and required 
a tracheostomy. She was subsequently sent to pulmonary rehab.  
.  
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1596**] in 6/2 who performed a rigid 
bronchoscopy here followed by replacement of her tracheostomy 
tube. She was found to have a circumferential area of stenosis 
below the cricoid cartilage extending 6cm; it was not felt to be 
granulation tissue. DEbridement was minimally successful. A CT 
scan was done which showed that she had:  
-Focal tracheal stenosis at the inferior extent of the 
tracheostomy tube.  
-There was also: proximal narrowing which may relate to 
granulation tissue versus secretions.  
-Polypoid soft tissue density just above the insertion of the 
tracheostomy tube may relate to granulation tissue.  
.  
- she was discharged back to rehab  
.  
On [**2623-4-27**], she was then admitted to [**Hospital3 875**] with SOB 
and desatted to the low 90s. She was given O2, suctioning and 
nebulizers without significant improvement. Initially, she was 
started on Levoquin and finished a 14 day course for suspected 
bronchitis. Her respiratatory status improved and hence she did 
not require ventilation.  
.  
She was found on HOD #2 to have Enterococcus bacteremia - via Cx 
x 2 on [**4-27**] and Cx x 2 on [**4-28**]. (A TTE was negative for 
vegetations. A TEE was not performed). As such, She was started 
on Vancomycin with subsequent negative surveillance cultures.  
.  
[**5-1**]: ID was consulted. They added on Gent once her urine 
culture came back positive for Klebsiella UTI. This particular 
Klebsiella UTI was only sensitive to Gentamicin, Imipenem, Zosyn 
and Cefotetan.  
- Started on Imipenem on [**2623-5-17**] for this.  
.  
On [**5-12**], she was obtunded and had significant mucous secretions 
and mucus plugging requiring suctioning; ENT changed her 
cuffless trach from a #6 to a #4 and transitioned to a trach 
collar after transient ventilation.  
.  
On [**5-12**], she has a IJ TLC placed in OR at [**Hospital1 **].  
On [**5-15**], noticed to have ""mild stridor"" and mild tachypnea and 
was replaced on a ventilator.  
.  
Of note:  
- was found to be C Diff + and was started on flagyl  
.  
Today, she is transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for further options regarding 
placement of a new tracheostomy tube.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2623-5-17**] 8:17 PM
A tracheostomy tube terminates within the trachea just above the 
level of the clavicles. Left internal jugular vascular catheter 
terminates in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube 
courses below the diaphragm. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
There are patchy and linear areas of atelectasis at the lung 
bases. There is a questionable small left pleural effusion.
.
TEE [**2623-5-19**]   
Conclusions:  
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left  
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial  
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). The ascending,  
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter 
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. A bioprosthetic aortic valve 
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well 
seated, with thin leaflets that display normal motion. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  
IMPRESSION: Normal aortic bioprosthesis. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets. No vegetation 
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo female with history of tracheobronchomalacia transferred 
from OSH for further management.
MICU Course: Pt followed by IP, tracheomalacia c/w subglottic 
granulation tissue and Mid trach stenosis. S/P rigid bronch + 
excision, debridement, dilatation and trach change. She was 
managed for Acinobacter/Klebsiella VAP, +C-diff and followed by 
ID. TEE negative for vegetations. Pt back to MICU on [**5-27**] for 
aggressive fluid resuscitation given C-Diff colitis and poor PO 
intake with metabolic acidosis. Was given IVF w/bicarb, [**Doctor First Name 668**] 
following but not surgical candidate given comorbidities, 
started IVflagyl/PO vanco with slowly improving diarrhea. On 
[**5-27**] went into RAF, s/p CV now in NSR remains stable. 
Transferred to floor [**5-30**].
.  
# Respiratory:  
**Tracheomalacia: This was noted on previous admission to [**Hospital1 83**]. 
 
- s/p laser removal of tissue x 2 in the past
- on [**5-21**]: was switched from vent to trach mask and tolerated 
this well  
- on [**5-23**]: had rigid [**Last Name (un) 5733**], electrocautery and balloon dilatation 
of trachea and upsizing of her trach to a #7 -> Will need a 
special long trach which was ordered and will be available on 
[**6-2**]. Per IP underwent a trach change with T-tube placement on 
[**6-2**] without complications. Her trach was capped with stable 
O2sats and voice audible. Per IP her trach is to be capped 
during the day and with humidified O2 at night for her OSA. If 
pt needs oxygenation she can be oxygenated with nasal cannula O2 
with capped trach.
.   
**Acinobacter/Klebsiella VAP: Started Bactrim on [**5-21**], completed 
14 day course on [**6-3**]
-- Continue mucinex PRN mucus buildup   
-- D/Cd atrovent, albuterol standing nebs  
-- pt was on solumedrol 60 IV BID prior to admission (unclear 
reason why, ? COPD flare), and pt was started on taper on [**2623-5-18**] 
and completed taper without any difficulties
.  
# ID:  Pt had hx of enteroccus bacteremia, which was believed to 
be treated adequately with 23 day course of vanc at OSH.  She 
had a TEE here, which was negative for vegetation, per ID 
recommendations the vanc was d/c'd. Surveillance cx's were NGTD. 
 Pt grew acinetobacter from her sputum, and was started on 
bactrim on [**5-21**] for 14 day course for Vent Associated PNA.  Pt 
also had hx of klebsiella UTI, and had been treated with 
imipenem at OSH. Per ID recommendations, pt was likely colonized 
from frequent foley catheterizations, and imipenem was d/c'd. Pt 
had dirty UA on admission here, but urine cx only grew yeast.  
Attempted to contact [**Hospital1 2716**] to obtain records of antimicrobial 
succeptibilities of sternal infections and bacteremias in past. 
Sternal wound infection was Staph and Proteus per surgical 
summary. However, they did not send the micro data, so will need 
to call the micro lab at some point in the future for further 
information.  Pt had hx of C.dif, and was continued on flagyl 
for additional 14 day course. Pt had low grade temps during her 
MICU stay (with a Tmax of 100.5), but did not have a significant 
temp spike. She then had explosive diarrhea with +C-diff in 
stools. She had persistent diarrhea, resistent to PO flagyl 
treatment, she was started on PO Vanco as well as IV flagyl on 
[**5-26**] for C-diff colitis. ID again reconsulted for persistent 
diarrhea and elevated WBC. Her diarrhea improved with PO Vanco 
and IVflagyl, her WBC peaked at 29 and came down to 14.4 at time 
of discharge. She was also started on Meropenem on [**5-27**] for 
Klebsiella UTI. Per ID she was to continue PO Vanco/flagyl until 
all other Antibiotics d/c'd and diarrhea improved. She remained 
afebrile with improving WBC and no new culture data. She will 
complete a recommended 10day course of meropenem on [**2623-6-5**]. She 
remained afebrile with improving WBC and no new culture data at 
time of discharge.
.
#. C-DIFF Colitis: pt with explosive diarrhea treated for C-diff 
as noted above. She was followed closely by surgery, however 
given her other comorbidities she was not a surgical candidate. 
She was followed with daily KUBs, her last KUB notable for 
improvement in loops of bowel size. However, notable for small 
bowel obstruction on [**2623-5-28**]. Pt was kept on a clear liquid diet 
with plan to advance when improved colities. Her stool output 
improved at time of discharge. Continued c-diff precuations.
.  
# Neuro:  
Seizure Prophylaxis  
- on phenytoin (likely since she had subdural sustained in 4/06) 
 
- continued phenytoin during this admission, increased dose 
given low albumin and subtherapeutic with corrected dose. 
Changed dose from 200mgqAM to 300mg qAM and increased 300mg qPM 
to 400mgqPM. She did not have any siezure activity while 
hospitalized.
- CT from OSH revealed mass in supracisternal region on R and 
patient notes that she has had changes in vision in her R eye - 
specificially she notes seeing random objects since her fall. Pt 
had R homonymous hemianopsia and was to follow up with 
neuroopthamology.  
- [**5-22**]: contacted Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5735**] (Endocrine at [**Hospital1 253**]) regarding 
her pituitary tumor.  restarted her on carbergoline for her 
prolactinoma. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5735**] should reckeck prolactin levels in 
6 weeks since prolactin levels elevated during this admission. 
Plan to continue Cabergoline at current dose 0.5mg 2x/week. If 
her Prolactin levels are persistently elevated may increase dose 
0.75mg 2x/week.
- pituitary tumor is a prolactinoma and measures approx 5cm x 
2.5cm x 3cm  
.  
# Renal:  
- Cr 1.5 on admission; this is similar to level when she left 
[**Hospital1 **]  
- Renally dose medications -> increaed Cr on [**5-24**] with peak to 
2.4 due to poor PO intake and explosive diarrhea. Renal followed 
pt, found no muddy brown casts, ARF c/w prerenal etiology also 
ATN in setting of poor forward flow. She was agressively 
hydrated in the MICU with addition of 50mEq NaHCO3. Her ARF 
improved with Cr. decreased to 1.6 at time of discharge. Her IVF 
were discontinued on [**6-2**] as she was significantly volume 
overloaded and making urine, although poorly ~700cc per day.
.
#. Metabolic Acidosis: Pt with explosive diarrhea with low 
bicarb. She was started on 50mEQ NaHCO3w/1000ml 1/2NS to manage 
metabolic acidosis. Her HCO3 improved, her hypernatremia 
corrected. However, she also developed hyponatremia with IVF 
resuscitation. Her IVF were d/c'd on [**6-2**], her HCO3 at time of 
discharge was 19.
.  
# Cardio:  Pt s/p CABG in the past, she also went into AFlutter 
for which she was cardioverted on [**5-27**]. She remained in NSR. She 
did not tolerate a BB throughout her hospital course due to 
hypotension. she was continued on an ASA and statin. No other 
antihypertensive medication was added to her medical regimen. 
Her SBP was stable at time of discharge SBP 115. d/c'd HCTZ 
during this admission, due to borderline low BP and likely need 
for BB in the future
.  
# DM2:  Her BS was persistently elevated while she was on 
steroids. She was maintained on an ISS which was titrated for 
better BS control. Check FS QID  
.  
# GERD: continued PPI  
.  
# PPX:  PPI, fondaparinaux for DVT PPX (pt has hx of HIT). 
However fondaparinaux was held prior to IP procedure, but was 
restarted s/p procedure.  head of bed at 30 degress  
.  
# FEN:  Pt grossly volume overloaded. Allow pt to autodierese 
and holding further IVF. Currenlty receiving TPN since poor PO 
intake; clear liquid diet until colitis improved. Note on [**5-22**]: 
had FEES study by speech/swallow team -> OK to have nectar thick 
liquids and ground solids, however changed diet to clear liq due 
to colitis. Will need a new nutrition evaluation at [**Hospital1 910**] to advance diet.  
.  
# Access: L subclavian - placed in OR on [**5-12**] at [**Hospital3 875**] 
 
- removed on [**5-19**] with no growth on culture data  
- switched PICC on [**5-22**] because patient has HIT. Hence switched 
to [**Last Name (un) 5736**] PICC which does not require heparin.
