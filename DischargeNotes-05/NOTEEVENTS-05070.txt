                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  56 year old woman with CLL status post allogenous bone marrow
     transplant, now with sinus pain.
     
     Contiguous 3 mm axial images were obtained through the paranasal sinuses.
     Coronal reformatted images were generated from this data set.  No prior
     studies are available for comparison.  No contrast was administered.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a small mucous retention cyst, or polyp, in the right
     maxillary sinus.  There is minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses
     bilaterally, somewhat more prominent on the left than right.  The reformats
     are not adequate for a thorough evaluation of the ostiomeatal complexes.
     However, the right OMC appears to be patent.  There is soft tissue in the
     region of the left OMC, and it may be obstructed at the time the study was
     performed.  However, the left maxillary sinus appears normal.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Small mucous retention cyst, or polyp, in the right maxillary
     sinus.  Mucosal thickening in the region of the left ostiomeatal complex,
     perhaps occluding the complex at the time the imaging was performed.  No other
     abnormalities are detected.

     HISTORY:  56 y/o woman with fever and status post bone marrow transplant.
     
     CHEST PA/LATERAL:  Comparison is not available.  The heart is slightly
     enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  There is no focal
     consolidation or pleural effusion.  There are several small calcified
     densities noted in the right mid lung zone.  The visualized osseous structures
     appear unremarkable.  There is a central venous catheter terminating in the
     upper SVC.  Also noted are multiple surgical clips overlying the left breast,
     and please correlate with patient's prior surgical procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of acute pneumonia or CHF.
     2)  There are several calcified densities in the right mid lung zone, which
     could represent calcified lymph nodes that are secondary to old TB or other
     granulomatous disease.  Comparison with prior chest radiograph would be
     helpful.

Admission Date:  [**2850-7-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2850-8-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2793-10-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL ICU/OMED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old Italian
female with past medical history significant for CLL status
post allo BMT in [**2850-3-5**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 184**] secondary to a several day
history of fevers.  The patient initially presented to
Hematology/Oncology Clinic on [**7-12**] with a temperature of
101.9.  At that time, her left PICC line was D/C'd and blood
cultures sent.  She was treated with a dose of Vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and given IV hydration.  The patient has also
had a two week history of a frontal headache and as a result,
a head CT was attained in outpatient clinic, which revealed
findings of a sinusitis.

At that time, the patient's outpatient prednisone dose was
increased from 15 q.d. to 20 b.i.d.  She refused admission,
but agreed to return to clinic the very next day still
febrile.  She was treated again with a gram of Vancomycin and
ceftriaxone.  She was also given IV Solu-Medrol and IV
hydration yet again.  This continued for another day again
the same drill.  She finally agreed to admission and
presented to the ED on the 12th with continued fevers and
chills along with a two day history of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was given
100 mg of Solu-Medrol as well as Levaquin, Flagyl, and
Vancomycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CLL status post allo BMT in [**2850-3-5**].
2. Questionable graft-versus-host disease.
3. History of CMV viremia x3.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. CellCept 250 b.i.d.
2. Magnesium oxide.
3. Prednisone 20 b.i.d.
4. Bactrim [**MD Number 357**] strength q Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
5. Diflucan 200 q.d.
6. Protonix 40 q.d.
7. Ativan 1 b.i.d.
8. Colace 100 b.i.d. prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband and
daughters.  She denies any alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.7, blood
pressure 92/50, pulse 130, sating 98% on 2 liters and 97% on
room air with a respiratory rate of 17.  In general, the
patient appeared fatigued, but was in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes were dry.  Oropharynx was clear.  Her skin
revealed a perioral, nasolabial, and chin erythematous rash
with white scaly patches.  Cardiac examination revealed a
tachycardic S1, S2, but regular and no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Abdomen was benign.
Left Hickman site was without erythema or pus.  Extremities
were without any edema.  She did have 1-2 cm erythematous
round well demarcated macules on her arms, buttocks, and legs
as well as her trunk that all partially blanched and were
nontender.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of 7.4
with 10 polys, 7 bands, 59 lymphocytes, 16 monocytes, and 12
atypicals.  Absolute granulocyte count was 7,840.  Sodium was
131, bicarb 16, anion gap of 15, creatinine was 1.3, INR 2.5.
AST 132, ALT 303, LDH 384, alkaline phosphatase 106, total
bilirubin 1.7, lipase 117, amylase 312, albumin 3.9, TSH 2.
Urinalysis showed [**3-9**] granular hyaline casts, 250 glucose,
trace protein, few bacteria.  CMV viral load was negative.
Urine, blood, and tip cultures initially remained negative.

Chest x-ray revealed a questionable retrocardiac density.
KUB showed no obstruction.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
146 with T-wave inversions in I and L as well as left atrial
enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a long and protracted
course on the Bone Marrow Transplant service most marked by
grade 4 graft-versus-host disease, with involvement of  the GI
tract and the skin that did not respond to steroids. 
She developed progressive multiorgan failure. On she was
transferred  to the Fenard ICU on
[**7-30**] in multiorgan failure.

She developed acute oliguric renal failure. .  Her grade 4 graft-
versus-host disease of the GI tract and the skin continued to
progress despite high doses of Solu-Medrol, CellCept, Remicade,
and cyclosporin.  Her LFTs continued to rise with a peak total
bilirubin of 19.9 on transfer to the MICU.  She also
continued to have unrelenting diarrhea.

She developed microangiopathic changes and DIC  with an INR that
continued to rise eventually reaching 1.7 with schistocytes on
her smear, a low fibrinogen and a LDH of 1,922.  As a result, a
question of TTP vs  HUS arose.  She also developed paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation with intermittent rapid ventricular
response.  As a result, she was given both IV metoprolol and
diltiazem in the form of a drip to keep her heart rate
controlled.

In addition, her mental status began to decline.  This was
thought to be multifactorial in etiology in part due to
uremic/hepatic encephalopathy, questionable TTP, and drug
induced as the patient had been receiving high doses of
benzodiazepines and narcotics in the setting of hepatic and
renal function.

Once she was transferred to the Medical ICU, it was decided
to discontinue all mind-altering medications.  As she was
given fluid boluses in last effort to improve her urinary
output but without effect. She became persistently more hypoxic
with agonal breathing at times.  Her white count also continued
to rise on a daily basis with no clear etiology as all cultures
continue to remain negative.  She, however, remained on broad-
spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

Towards the end of her hospital course, however, the
patient's chest x-ray did reveal multiple nodules bilaterally
very concerning for fungal infection.  In light of her
worsening clinical condition. On  [**8-1**] because of
progressive declining clinical condition the family requested a 
DNR/DNI order. It was decided to continue
the current level of care including all medications and
laboratory draws, but there was to be no escalation of
treatment (i.e., no intubation, hemodialysis, or pressors).

The patient later that afternoon became
persistently more hypotensive and bradycardic likely
secondary to her progressively increasing acidemia from her
renal failure.  As a result, she passed away at 4:15 p.m. on
[**2850-8-1**] with her entire family present in the room.
The request for autopsy was denied.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Stage IV graft-versus-host disease.
2. Multiorgan failure.

     INDICATION:  56 year old female with increased LFT's.  Evaluate for
     cholelithiasis.
     
     FINDINGS:  The gallbladder is normal in appearance with no evidence of
     gallstones.  The common duct is not dilated measuring 6 mm distally.  There is
     evidence of slightly increased echogenicity of the hepatic parenchyma.  There
     is a hypoechoic lesion in the periportal region with evidence of internal flow

     PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST [**2850-7-31**] @ 2:37 P.M.:
     
     Please note the exam is technically limited. There is cut off of right lateral
     chest and respiratory motion degrades evaluation of the lungs. However, it is
     clear that there are multiple nodules bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION: Markedly limited exam. New nodular densities in both lung fields
     warrant a repeat examination at no charge to the patient.

     PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST:
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2850-7-31**].
     
     Left axillary clips are again noted.  There are right and left central venous
     lines with tips terminating at the level of the lower and mid SVC
     respectively.  The heart size and mediastinal contour are within normal
     limits.  There are nodular bilateral areas of ground glass opacity with
     increasing more confluent left retrocardiac opacity.  There are no pleural
     effusion or pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Nodular bilateral parenchymal opacities and worsening confluent
     left retrocardiac opacity.  The findings are concerning for an infectious
     process. Atypical infection such as fungal organism should be considered.
     Septic emboli can also produce this appearance.
