Cc:[**CC Contact Info 7175**] 

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF
 
History of Present Illness:
.  
HPI:  
83M with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG in [**2815**], MVR in [**2824**], 
CHF, and COPD, presents to the ED after experiencing R hip pain 
following a fall. He states that he was bending over, and became 
dizzy with blurred visual after standing up abruptly. He fell on 
his side. He denies LOC or head trauma. Films taken at his rehab 
([**Hospital3 **]) demonstrated R femoral neck fracture, and he 
was sent to BID ED. Of note, CXR at rehab on [**2830-8-30**] suggested 
evidence of RLL and LUL infiltrate, and was started on 
Levofloxacin 500mg PO qD x 10 days.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS were BP 134/69, HR 71, RR 18, SaO2 95% 2L 
NC. Hip films confirmed R femoral neck fracture. Initial labs 
significant for INR 5.4, on coumadin. CT head showed no evidence 
of hemorrhage. He was seen by orthopedic surgery, who 
recommended admission to medicine service for medical 
optimization prior to likely ORIF surgery [**9-5**]. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5002**] 
also complained of mild flank pain. A UA was ordered once he 
reached the floor.

gene.  
. 
 
Physical Exam:
.  
PE: TL 97.1F BP: 135/60, HR: 79, RR: 30, SaO2: 90% 2L (prior to 
neb treatment).  
Gen: Ill appearing gentleman, lying in bed, NAD  
HEENT: PERRL, sclerae anicteric, OP clear  
Neck: Supple, no LAD, previous orifice from trach visible  
CV: RRR, II/VI SEM LUSB, mech valve click, +S3  
Chest: Crackles R base, no w/r  
Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS  
Extr: R leg externally rotated, 2+ DPs bilaterally  
Neuro: A&Ox3  

 
Pertinent Results:
 
ECG [**2830-9-4**]: V-paced at 84bpm  
[**2830-9-7**]: Atrial fibrillation. Right axis deviation. Compared to 
the previous tracing of [**2830-9-4**] there is deep T wave inversion 
in leads II, III, aVF and V3-V6 consistent with active ischemic 
process. Rule out infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.
 

.  
Imaging:  
CXR [**2830-9-4**]:  
Cardiomegaly, s/p CABG and MVR, dual-lead PPM. Elevation of 
right hemidiaphragm with volume loss and interstitial opacities 
c/w CHF. Also focal opactiy over R lung zone and fluid in 
fissure, could be c/w PNA. Small effusions, no PTX.  
.  
Head CT [**2830-9-4**]:  
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial 
hemorrhage. The ventricles, cisterns and sulci are mildly 
prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes. 
Multiple patchy areas of hypodensity in the white matter 
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease, and 
include hypodensity which is more prominent, but unchanged 
within the left subinsular cortex. A bony protuberance about the 
ossicle may represent an osteoma which is unchanged or merely a 
congenital variant.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  
2. Evidence of age related involutional changes and white matter 
disease, unchanged.  
.  
Hip films: There is a comminuted right femoral neck fracture. 
Subtle angulation is present. No other fracture is identified.  
IMPRESSION: Right femur fracture.  
.  
[**1-27**] PFTs:  
FVC 1.98L (51% predicted)  
FEV1 1.25L (51% predicted)  
FEV1/FVC: 63% (100% predicted)  
.  
[**11-22**] TTE:  
EF 40%. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium 
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed 
secondary to severe inferior and posterior hypokinesis and mild 
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle; the ejection 
fraction is approximately 40 percent. There is moderate global 
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic 
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets 
are moderately thickened. There is no significant aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty 
ring is present. There is moderate thickening of the mitral 
valve chordae. Moderate  
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet 
is eccentric. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.  
[**5-23**] Cath: (prior to MVR)  
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
three  
vessel CAD. The left main coronary artery had a 40% distal 
stenosis. The LAD had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis, and there was 
competitive flow from the LIMA in the distal LAD. The ramus 
intermedius branch had a 40% proximal stenosis. The left 
circumflex artery was totally occluded proximally. The RCA had a 
diffusely diseased proximal segment and was totally occluded 
after the first acute marginal branch.  
2. Graft arteriography revealed a patent LIMA to the LAD. The 
SVG to the rPDA was widely patent, and the rPDA distal to the 
anastamosis had a 70% stenosis. The SVG to the obtuse marginal 
branch was ectatic but without significant stenosis and the 
marginal branch distal to the anastamosis supplied collaterals 
to the right postero-lateral branch.  
3. Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed severe pulmonary  
hypertension witha PA systolic pressure of 92 mmHg. There was 
increased right and left sided filling pressures with a mean RA 
pressure of 16 mmHg, a mean PCWP of 28 mmHg and an LVEDP of 22 
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3 L/min/m2.  
4. Left ventriculography revealed global hypokinesis with 
posterobasal wall akinesis and moderate-to-severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.  
2. Patent LIMA and SVGs.  
3. Moderate-to-severe (3+) mitral regurgitation.  
4. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.  
5. Severe pulmonary hypertension

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted for optimization of medical status prior to 
operation for hip fx.  stable until early [**9-6**] around 12:oo am 
when began desatting to the high 80s on 2L NC. Vital signs o/w 
at the time: T 97.3 BPs 90s-100s/30s-60s, HR 60s-70s, rr in the 
high 20s. Pt was also noted to be increasingly somnolent and 
unresponsive. Pt placed on 100% FM with improvement of sats. He 
had been given MS contin 45 mg at 11 am the day prior and was 
therefore given narcan 0.2 mg X1 and narcan 0.4 mg X1 several 
hours later. He was given lasix 10 mg IV X3 o/n. Mental status 
improved somewhat with the early dose of narcan. CXR checked at 
the onset of the pt's change in status demonstrated worsened 
bibasilar pna.
ABG trend o/n was as follows:
12:20 am 7.33/68/70
4:00 am 7.23/90/65
6:00 am 7.27/79/60
At time of MICU eval ABG was checked and demonstrated 
7.05/139/125. Given worsening respiratory status pt transferred 
to the unit. Code status confirmed with family to be DNR/DNI. 
HCP felt that NIPPV would be an in-line with the pt's wishes.  
Pt. EKG showed new Afib with ST changes worrisome for ischemia 
and trop leak without elevation of CK in context of rapidly 
progressive ARF.  He was given trial of NIPPV overnight without 
much improvement of MS.  In discussion with pt.'s family, it was 
decided to choose comfort care interventions.  He was placed on 
morphine drip and passed [**9-7**] with family around

Events: Code status changed to comfort measures only at approx 0100. Morphine gtt running. Pt seems comfortable. 

Received pt on MMV on vent which was changed to CPAP with slightly improving ABG's. However, pt's mental status continued to wax and wane. Occasionally able to open eyes to command, but largely minimally responsive. Blood pressure kept with a systolic above 80 with 500cc ns boluses x2. Urine output minimal. At 0030, pt with dropping oxygen saturation down to 85%. CPaP mask taken off and pt deep suctioned x2 for thick bloody sputum. Pt with no gag or cough at this time. Also completely unresponsive to painful stimuli. CPAP mask returned and pt placed on 100% with very slow return to O2 sat of 90. Family called and decision made by HCP to change code status to cmo. CPAP mask removed and morphine gtt initiated. Currnent rate is 10. Pt appears comfortable. Lung sounds are quite diminished throughout, increasing ectopy on monitor, b/p at 0400 65/18. Pastor in to administer last rites.
