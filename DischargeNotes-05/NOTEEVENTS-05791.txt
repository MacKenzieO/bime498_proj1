Date of Birth:   [**2731-6-23**]     Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old male with
known metastatic renal cancer and known portal vein
thrombosis and biliary obstruction with esophageal varices,
diagnosed in [**2777-4-24**], who was transferred from an
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2777-11-18**].  At that time, he complained of
nausea and vomiting times three days, hematemesis, and melena
times two days.  He was noted to have hematemesis in the
Emergency Department and his admission hematocrit was 20.1.
He was started on Sandostatin drip.

[**3-27**]+ esophageal varices without acute bleed and without
stigmata of bleed.  A red clot was seen on the greater curve
of the fundus without an active bleed.  There was an adherent
clot with normal underlying mucosa.  No [**Doctor First Name 973**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears
and patient had received nine units of packed red blood cells
with an increase in hematocrit to 23.5.  Patient also
received eight units of FFP for INR of 1.5.  He also received
10 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K and was then transferred to
[**Hospital6 807**] for further management.
Patient was witnessed to have around 500 cc of bright red
blood with clots in route.  Also, had bright red blood per
rectum at that time.  Patient had not been hemodynamically
stable at any time prior to admission.

splenomegaly with a splenic mass, splenic vein obliterated by
tumor with collateral varices, status post right nephrectomy,
lesion of left kidney, inguinal and pelvic lymph[**MD Number 65**], no
free fluid and persistent extrinsic occlusion of the portal
vein.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography from [**2777-8-2**]:  Limited exam of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum all
normal.  Malignant looking common bile duct stricture with
multiple filling defects and a 7 cm stent was placed.

Alkaline phosphatase was 257 but otherwise normal liver
function tests.

Electrocardiogram on [**11-18**] at outside hospital with
sinus tachycardia at 122, axis 61, intervals 125.84.419
corrected.  No ST elevation or depression.  T wave inversion
in III.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This was a 46-year-old man with
metastatic renal cancer with known esophageal varices and
portal hypertension, secondary to extrinsic compression of
the portal system by the mass and portal vein thrombosis who
presented to an outside hospital with an upper
gastrointestinal bleed thought to be secondary to gastric
varices.

1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient with endoscopy
at outside hospital, negative for stigma of variceal bleed,
most likely secondary to gastric varices.  The patient was
put on octreotide and Protonix.  Despite this, patient
continues to have active bleeding.  Patient was planned to
have abdominal ultrasound and then Gastrointestinal and
Interventional Radiology to evaluate.  Hematocrit will be
followed and transfusion prn.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal was consulted and an
emergent abdominal ultrasound was done which showed limited
portal vein flow distally.  A multiphasic CT showed unchanged
metastases with portal vein flow distally but minimal flow
proximally.  Interventional Radiology was contacted and a
portal vein stent was placed along with an external-internal
biliary drain which drained percutaneously in one direction
and also into the duodenum.  Patient received a total of 28
units of packed red blood cells and 23 units of FFP.  During
the procedure, which the patient was stented by
Interventional Radiology, he went under general anesthesia.
There was some difficulty extubating the patient and he was
ultimately extubated two days later.  He developed a left
lower lobe pneumonia, believed to be due to an aspiration
pneumonia during patient's intubation.  He was put on a ten
day course of Levaquin and clindamycin.  Enterococcus also
grew out from patient's bile which was sensitive to Levaquin
and thus treated with a ten day course of Levaquin, also used
for the pneumonia.

Difficult with extubation, secondary to low oxygen
saturation.  Patient was later found to have an abnormally
high AA gradient and also a VQ mismatch.  This was believed
to possibly be secondary to small pulmonary emboli being sent
from patient's existent left popliteal deep vein thrombosis.
Interventional Radiology was again consulted and an IVC
filter was attempted to be placed secondary to patient's
inability to be anticoagulated.  During the procedure, it was
discovered that patient's inferior vena cava was abruptly
tapered secondary to extrinsic compression by tumor.
Therefore, a filter was not placed at that time.  Patient
remained on a 100% nonrebreather for two to three days and
ultimately his oxygen was weaned as his pneumonia resolved.
On [**11-28**], on the day of discharge, patient was
saturating between 92 and 99% on room air and was not
experiencing any dyspnea on exertion with ambulation and
denied any cough.

During patient's intubation, he was agitated on his vent,
and, therefore, started on propofol at which time he became
hypotensive and required Neo-Synephrine in order to maintain
blood pressure.  Patient also experienced acute renal failure
likely secondary to the dye load given during a CT and angio
procedure during the admission.  Patient maintained good
urine output and creatinine rose to 1.8, then resolved on its
own.

The patient's diet was slowly advanced from NPO to a full
regular diet.  Patient at time of discharge was able to
tolerate all foods.  His hematocrit remained stable for five
to six days around 30.  Patient's total bilirubin also rose
to a peak of 20.  Once the total bilirubin had peaked, it
began to drop status post drainage procedure a few points a
day.  In the days prior to discharge it had dropped from
16.6, 12.7 to 10.6, 10.0, 9.5 and on the day of discharge to
8.4.  Interventional Radiology was again consulted and it was
decided that patient could have the drain capped and be
discharged home with visiting nursing assistant and follow-up
one week later with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 645**] and the Interventional Radiology
Clinic.

Also, during the admission, patient with a liquid diet for
which stool studies were sent.  All cultures and fecal
leukocytes were negative.  Ova and parasites was never sent.

Patient was finally discharged on [**2777-12-7**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastric
varices.
2.  Portal vein thrombosis.
3.  Renal cell cancer with metastases.
4.  Deep vein thrombosis, status post internal and external
biliary stent, status post portal vein stent and peripheral
neuropathy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Clindamycin 300 mg po q.i.d. until [**12-3**].
2.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
3.  Ativan 1-2 mg po q. 8 hours prn.
4.  Propranolol 60 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. until [**12-2**].
6.  Patient was sent home with an extra biliary drainage bag
so that patient may attach the bag if it becomes obstructed
and call his Oncologist or Interventional Radiology Clinic.

FOLLOW-UP:  Patient to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 645**] and also with
Interventional Radiology Clinic on [**12-7**].  A VNA was
set up to flush the catheterization with 10 cc of saline and
dressing changes q.d.  The patient was sent home on a regular
diet.

Addendum: Patient developed moderate abdominal discomfort
shortly after arrival home and was told by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50**] to uncap the
biliary drain and resume external drainage. This relieved the
patient's symptoms.

     HISTORY: Active GI bleed, assess patency of portal vein.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Portal Doppeler study.
     
     FINDINGS: There is no flow in the proximal portal vein. There is flow in the
     distal main portal vein as well as the right portal vein. There are multiple
     artifacts from pneumobilia, a small amount of flow is seen in the left portal
     vein, this is probably related to collaterals. There is perihepatic ascites
     and a large retroperitoneal mass extending into the region of the porta
     hepatis.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Recannulization of the distal main portal vein, right portal
     vein and left portal vein by collateral branches. Main extrahepatic
     portal vein not identified, but surrounded by large bulky nodal masses. Study
     is limited due to patient's status and pneumobilia.

     bleeding.  Evaluate portal system and liver parenchyma for TIPS procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  A helical CT scan was acquired prior to and following IV
     administration of 150 cc Optiray.  Optiray was administered per patient
     request.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions are
     present.  Massive mesenteric and periportal metastatic lymphadenopathy is
     present resulting in occlusion of the splenic and extrahepatic main portal
     vein and entirely encircling a patent but markedly attenuated splenic artery
     and common hepatic artery.  Extensive collateral vessels are present
     reconstituting the patent left and right portal veins in the porta hepatis.
     Cavernous transformation of the main portal vein and the left and right portal
     veins is noted.  A splenorenal shunt is identified.  The spleen is massively
     enlarged with perisplenic varices traveling anteriorly around the greater
     curvature of the stomach.  No focal mass lesions are present in the liver and
     pneumobilia is identified of uncertain significance.  Gallbladder wall varices
     are also identified.  The gallbladder is distended.  The right kidney has been
     removed and is entirely replaced by a large bulky mass.  Left kidney is
     unremarkable.  Ascites is present throughout the abdomen.
     
     PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The left kidney is excreting contrast.  Ureter
     visualized throughout its length down to insertion into the bladder.  Free
     pelvic fluid is noted. The opacified loops of large and small bowel are
     unremarkable.  Numerous calcifications are present in the prostate.  Bladder
     is unremarkable.  Several small sigmoid diverticula are present.  When
     compared to the study from [**2777-9-5**], there appears to be progression and
     increasing size of the metastatic disease, particularly of the mass in the
     right renal fossa.

Cardiac: He was orthostatic by HR this am but not by B/P.  HR 100's, B/P 100-118/60's.  His HR increased to 130's around 1400 but this was in response to expecting his teen age daughters arrival, after they were here his HR dropped to 90's, his B/P 118-132/84.

Resp: O2 sats with 5l NC O2 sats 97-99%.  The flow was decreased to 3l NC to decrease risk of nose bleed and his sats were 92-93%.

GU: Pt reported that he had been voiding in the toilet when he was stooling.  Since he was asked to void in the urinal he has not voided.

Neuro: Pt is awake and alert with minimal signs of encephlopathy.  He has not been dizzy or lightheaded when getting OOB.

Social: [**Doctor First Name **], his wife has been in most of the day.  She was told of the grave prognosis and called in her family.  They were saying Good-bye all day.  They have been very cooperative and appropriate.  Wife to stay in the room tonight.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      46 year old man with metastatic renal cell CA with extensive abd mets who has
      had two CBD stents after developed biliary obstruction from tumor burden, now
      with reocclusion of stent by tumor.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      h/o metastatic renal cell ca with extensive abd mets incl. periportal mets
      current cbd stent now obstructed with tumor and bilirubin on rise.
      please try to place perc biliary drainage tube.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  46 y/o male with metastatic renal cancer, causing
     obstruction of a portal vein as seen on CT scan.  Patient has bleeding gastric
     varices and requires relief of portal vein obstruction to ameliorate upper GI
     bleeding.  Patient also has biliary obstruction as seen by imaging, despite
     two prior common bile duct stents via ERCP.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was
                                                                 (Over)

     eventually traversed with the glidewire to a position in a superior mesenteric
     vein branch.  The splenic vein was not visualized, and attempts to pass the
     guidewire into the splenic vein were unsuccessful.  Angiograms with the
     catheter tip in a branch of the superior mesenteric vein demonstrated
     occlusion of an approximately 10 cm portion of the portal vein, with prominent
     collateral vessel seen arising from the portion of the portal vein which was
     not occluded more centrally.  Angiograms demonstrated before and after the
     first and second stent placements showed opening of the occluded portion of
     the portal vein with the stents.  The collateral filling was less obvious.
     Filling defects consistent with residual thrombus were seen in the lumen of
     the reopened portal vein.
     
     BILIARY DRAINAGE:  Injection of contrast into the biliary system demonstrated
     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external
     biliary stent demonstrated adequate placement of the stent with the distal
     pigtail in the duodenum, and the proximal side holes of the stent in the
     biliary system.

     1)  Opening of occluded portion of the main portal vein with two self-
     expanding stents described above.
     2)  Placement of an 8 French internal/external biliary drainage catheter.

     obstruction of a portal vein as seen on CT scan.  Patient has bleeding gastric
     varices and requires relief of portal vein obstruction to ameliorate upper GI
     bleeding.  Patient also has biliary obstruction as seen by imaging, despite
     two prior common bile duct stents via ERCP.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was
                                                                 (Over)

     eventually traversed with the glidewire to a position in a superior mesenteric
     vein branch.  The splenic vein was not visualized, and attempts to pass the
     guidewire into the splenic vein were unsuccessful.  Angiograms with the
     catheter tip in a branch of the superior mesenteric vein demonstrated
     occlusion of an approximately 10 cm portion of the portal vein, with prominent
     collateral vessel seen arising from the portion of the portal vein which was
     not occluded more centrally.  Angiograms demonstrated before and after the
     first and second stent placements showed opening of the occluded portion of
     the portal vein with the stents.  The collateral filling was less obvious.
     Filling defects consistent with residual thrombus were seen in the lumen of
     the reopened portal vein.
     
     BILIARY DRAINAGE:  Injection of contrast into the biliary system demonstrated
     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external
     biliary stent demonstrated adequate placement of the stent with the distal
     pigtail in the duodenum, and the proximal side holes of the stent in the
     biliary system.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Opening of occluded portion of the main portal vein with two self-
     expanding stents described above.
     2)  Placement of an 8 French internal/external biliary drainage catheter.

     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was
                                                                 (Over)

     vein branch.  The splenic vein was not visualized, and attempts to pass the
     guidewire into the splenic vein were unsuccessful.  Angiograms with the
     catheter tip in a branch of the superior mesenteric vein demonstrated
     occlusion of an approximately 10 cm portion of the portal vein, with prominent
     collateral vessel seen arising from the portion of the portal vein which was
     not occluded more centrally.  Angiograms demonstrated before and after the
     first and second stent placements showed opening of the occluded portion of
     the portal vein with the stents.  The collateral filling was less obvious.
     Filling defects consistent with residual thrombus were seen in the lumen of
     the reopened portal vein.
     
     BILIARY DRAINAGE:  Injection of contrast into the biliary system demonstrated
     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external
     biliary stent demonstrated adequate placement of the stent with the distal

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  46 y/o male with metastatic renal cancer, causing
     obstruction of a portal vein as seen on CT scan.  Patient has bleeding gastric
     varices and requires relief of portal vein obstruction to ameliorate upper GI
     bleeding.  Patient also has biliary obstruction as seen by imaging, despite
     two prior common bile duct stents via ERCP.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm

     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A

      46 year old man with metastatic renal cell CA with extensive abd mets who has
      had two CBD stents after developed biliary obstruction from tumor burden, now
      with reocclusion of stent by tumor.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  46 y/o male with metastatic renal cancer, causing
     obstruction of a portal vein as seen on CT scan.  Patient has bleeding gastric
     varices and requires relief of portal vein obstruction to ameliorate upper GI
     bleeding.  Patient also has biliary obstruction as seen by imaging, despite
     two prior common bile duct stents via ERCP.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was
                                                                 (Over)

     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was
                                                                 (Over)

     eventually traversed with the glidewire to a position in a superior mesenteric
     vein branch.  The splenic vein was not visualized, and attempts to pass the
     guidewire into the splenic vein were unsuccessful.  Angiograms with the
     catheter tip in a branch of the superior mesenteric vein demonstrated
     occlusion of an approximately 10 cm portion of the portal vein, with prominent
     collateral vessel seen arising from the portion of the portal vein which was
     not occluded more centrally.  Angiograms demonstrated before and after the
     first and second stent placements showed opening of the occluded portion of
     the portal vein with the stents.  The collateral filling was less obvious.
     Filling defects consistent with residual thrombus were seen in the lumen of
     the reopened portal vein.
     
     BILIARY DRAINAGE:  Injection of contrast into the biliary system demonstrated
     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external
     biliary stent demonstrated adequate placement of the stent with the distal
     pigtail in the duodenum, and the proximal side holes of the stent in the
     biliary system.

     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation, and manipulated until the wire passed into the duodenum.  A 5
     French end hole catheter was placed over the wire to a position within the
     duodenum, and the guidewire was removed and exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The
     catheter was removed, and an 8 French internal/external biliary drain placed
     under fluoroscopic observation, to a position with its tip in the duodenum and
     proximal side holes within the biliary system.  Contrast injection was
     performed, and images obtained to document adequate positioning of the biliary
     drain.  A standard sterile dressing was applied, and the biliary drain was
     placed to bag drainage.
     
     FINDINGS:
     PORTAL VEIN STENTING:  The first attempt to pass the needle into the liver and
     resulting angiogram demonstrated multiple large hepatic collaterals, which may
     have have been pericholecystic in nature.  The second angiogram obtained with
     the second needle puncture demonstrated the needle to be within the portal
     vein.  Angiograms also demonstrated an occluded portal vein which was

     vein branch.  The splenic vein was not visualized, and attempts to pass the
     guidewire into the splenic vein were unsuccessful.  Angiograms with the
     catheter tip in a branch of the superior mesenteric vein demonstrated
     occlusion of an approximately 10 cm portion of the portal vein, with prominent
     collateral vessel seen arising from the portion of the portal vein which was
     not occluded more centrally.  Angiograms demonstrated before and after the
     first and second stent placements showed opening of the occluded portion of
     the portal vein with the stents.  The collateral filling was less obvious.
     Filling defects consistent with residual thrombus were seen in the lumen of
     the reopened portal vein.
     
     BILIARY DRAINAGE:  Injection of contrast into the biliary system demonstrated
     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external

      had two CBD stents after developed biliary obstruction from tumor burden, now
      with reocclusion of stent by tumor.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY AND INDICATION:  46 y/o male with metastatic renal cancer, causing
     obstruction of a portal vein as seen on CT scan.  Patient has bleeding gastric
     varices and requires relief of portal vein obstruction to ameliorate upper GI
     bleeding.  Patient also has biliary obstruction as seen by imaging, despite
     two prior common bile duct stents via ERCP.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Attending radiologists, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 647**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**], and
     interventional Radiology fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the Angiography suite at which time general
     anesthesia was performed by the anesthesiology service.  The upper abdomen was
     sterilely prepped and draped.  Ultrasound was used to visualize the
     configuration and anatomy of the liver.  Using this ultrasound guidance a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver.  Test injection of contrast revealed a
     vascular structure, and a .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic
     observation into the vessel.  The wire was exchanged with an Acu-stick kit for
     a 5 French sheath and dilator system over the wire.  Angiogram obtained
     demonstrated filling of prominent collateral vessels in the liver.  Decision
     was made to repuncture to access the portal system, and as the sheath was
     withdrawn, multiple gel-foam pledgets were inserted through the sheath to
     obtain hemostasis.  After removal of the sheath hemostasis was achieved.  A
     second puncture under fluoroscopic observation using a 20 g. needle was
     performed in a manner similar to the first puncture.  The .018 guidewire was
     advanced, and a 5 French sheath placed.  Angiogram obtained at this point
                                                                 (Over)

     demonstrated filling of the portal vein.  A 5 French diagnostic catheter was
     advanced through the sheath and through this catheter a .035 glidewire was
     advanced into the area of the porta hepatis under fluoroscopic observation.
     Venogram performed with the catheter tip in the occluded portion of the portal
     vein demonstrated occlusion of the portal vein, with prominent filling of a
     collateral, likely around the gallbladder.  Further manipulation of the
     guidewire under fluoroscopic observation allowed advancement of the catheter
     into a patent mesenteric venous branch, which may be the left colic branch of
     the superior mesenteric vein.  Contrast angiogram was performed with the tip
     of the catheter in this mesenteric vein.  An 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent
     (smart stent) was placed under fluoroscopic observation in the more central
     (towards the confluence of the mesenteric veins) side of the obstruction, and
     an angiogram was obtained.  A 5 mm X 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed under
     fluoroscopic guidance inside the stent, and inflated multiple times along the
     stent to further open it.  This balloon was exchanged over a wire for an 8 mm
     X 4 cm balloon, which also had serial inflations within the stent to open the
     stent.  A second 8 mm X 30 mm self-expanding stent (smart stent) was placed
     toward the hepatic side of the occluded portal vein, with approximately 1 cm
     overlap with the previous stent.  Angiogram with the catheter tip in the
     portal vein was again performed.  This stent was also angioplastied with the 8
     mm X 30 cm  balloon.  An angiogram after stent placement was again performed.
     The sheath was removed, and gel-foam pledgets were placed in the fat
     parenchyma as the sheath was withdrawn to achieve hemostasis.
     
     The biliary stenting was then performed.  Under fluoroscopic observation a 20
     g. needle was advanced into the liver, and contrast was injected in small
     amounts while withdrawing the needle until the biliary system was engaged.  A
     .018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic observation through the needle
     into the biliary system.  The needle was removed and replaced with a 5 French
     sheath and a dilator system.  A .035 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopic

     obstruction of the biliary system, with no flow of contrast through the
     biliary stent which could be seen on fluoroscopy, which was previously placed
     endoscopically.  Contrast injection after placement of internal/external
     biliary stent demonstrated adequate placement of the stent with the distal
     pigtail in the duodenum, and the proximal side holes of the stent in the
     biliary system.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Opening of occluded portion of the main portal vein with two self-
     expanding stents described above.
     2)  Placement of an 8 French internal/external biliary drainage catheter.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      46 year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, admitted with an upper gi
      bleed, s/p transfusion with 23 units FFP.  LENI's today demonstrated left
      popliteal dvt.  please place ivc filter. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  46 year old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
     admitted for upper GI bleed.  Patient experienced sudden drop in O2 saturation
     with shortness of breath.  Known left popliteal DVT.  Requires IVC filter for
     PE prophylaxis.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1543**] [**Name (STitle) 156**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8372**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8373**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the staff
     radiologist, was present throughout the entire procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed written consent was obtained from the patient.  The right
     groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, and anesthesia was
     obtained with 1% Lidocaine.  A 19 gauge single-wall needle was utilized to
     puncture the right femoral vein and an 035 J guide wire was advanced through
     the needle into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was then
     exchanged for a 5 French pigtail catheter, which was advanced under
     fluoroscopic guidance to the level of the caval bifurcation.  A venogram was
     then performed.  Following examination of the venogram, the decision was made
     not to pursue placement of an IVC filter.  Therefore, the catheter was removed
     from the right femoral vein and pressure was applied to the right groin for
     approximately 5 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  1% Lidocaine was utilized for local anesthesia.  The patient
     received a total of 35 cc of Optiray contrast.  No medications were given for
     conscious sedation.
     
     FINDINGS:  The initial venogram of the IVC revealed abrupt tapering of the
     suprarenal IVC, likely secondary to extrinsic compression by extensive tumor
     mass within the abdomen.  Multiple large paraspinal collateral veins were
     present.  Because extrinsic compression on the IVC provides protection from
     massive PE propagating from the lower extremities, the decision was made that
     the patient would not benefit from placement of an IVC filter.  Therefore, the
     procedure was terminated without placement of a filter.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION: Suprarenal IVC abruptly tapered, likely secondary to extrinsic
     compression by extensive tumor burden, as seen on recent CT.  No IVC filter
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Metastatic renal cell cancer. Biliary obstruction.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8421**] [**Name (STitle) 8422**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 291**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5410**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**] --
     staff Radiologist, supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was explained to the patient and written informed
     consent was obtained.   The skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
     fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. A tube injection was
     performed. The tube was cut and 0.035 glide wire was advanced through the tube
     and manipulated through the common bile duct and into the duodenum.  The
     existing catheter which had come partially out was advanced into the common
     duct and the glide wire was exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] wire. The catheter was
     removed and a new 8 FR pigtail catheter was advanced over the wire into the
     duodenum. The wire was removed and the pigtail formed.  A tube injection was
     performed and the catheter position adjusted.  The catheter was secured to the
     skin with 0 silk and flexitract and was capped.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  0.5 mg Versed and 25 mg Fentanyl were administered with
     continuous hemodynamic monitoring. 15 cc Optiray 30% per patient request.
     
     FINDINGS:  Initial injection demonstrates the existing catheter had pulled
     back but remained within the biliary system.  Tube injection through new
     catheter demonstrated filling of the gallbladder from the superior most side
     hole. The catheter was then adjusted so the most superior side hole was in the
     common hepatic duct.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange over a wire of an 8 FR internal/external
     drainage catheter.  Existing catheter was shown to have pulled back which is
     why it was not functioning properly.

     HISTORY: 46 year old male with internal-external biliary drainage catheter
     replaced on [**2777-12-2**]. This study was requested today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**] to evaluate
     the position of the catheter.
     
     PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the angiographic table. The biliary
     system was initially decompressed by aspiration. Approximately 35 ml of
     Optiray 320 were then injected through the existing biliary catheter and
     several radiographs of the right upper abdominal quadrant were obtained, which
     demonstrated normal caliber intrahepatic biliary ducts and the common biliary
     duct to the level of the cystic duct, also filling the gallbladder. However,
     no contrast was visualized within the distal portion of the catheter. Also, no
     contrast was visualized in the duodenum. The distal pigtail is, however,
     located within the expected location of the duodenal lumen. Overall, the
     catheter appears to be in good position.
     
     IMPRESSION: Patient's internal-external biliary drainage catheter is in good
     position, but no contrast passage into the duodenal lumen. The findings were
     discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 647**] upon completion of the study.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  46 year old male with metastatic renal carcinoma and right
     nephrectomy.  Internal/external 8-French biliary drainage catheter placed on
     [**2777-11-21**] and exchanged on [**2777-12-2**].  There is now leakage around the
     catheter exit site with decreased output.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3238**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1791**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 291**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1078**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1791**], the
     Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  40 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; 1 mg Versed and 50 mcg of
     fentanyl intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was explained to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained.  Initially, contrast material was injected through the
     existing 8-French catheter which demonstrated opacification of the biliary
     tree, cystic duct, and duodenum, and therefore no obstruction of the catheter.
      The side holes were demonstrated to be in the appropriate position.  The
     radiographic appearance of the catheter is also identical to that of the time
     of placement on [**2777-12-12**]. Due to problems with leakage around the catheter,
     the tube was removed over an Amplatz guide wire, and exchanged for a 10-French
     pigtail catheter.  The locking loop mechanism was formed in the second portion
     of the duodenum, and injection of contrast demonstrates communication of the
     biliary tree with the duodenum. The tube was placed to external drainage
     according to the patient's wishes. The tube was secured to the patient's skin
     using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrack.
     
     FINDINGS:  Images obtained of the previously placed 8-French nephrostomy tube
     demonstrate the catheter to be in identical position relative to the previous
     study of [**2777-12-12**].  Images obtained following placement of the new 10-French
     catheter demonstrate the catheter to be entering from a right hepatic duct,
     coursing through the common hepatic bile duct, with the locking loop
     projecting over the duodenum.  There is opacification of the biliary tree,
     cystic duct, gallbladder and portions of duodenum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  46 year old male with metastatic renal carcinoma and right
     nephrectomy.  Internal/external 8-French biliary drainage catheter placed on
     [**2777-11-21**] and exchanged on [**2777-12-2**].  There is now leakage around the
     catheter exit site with decreased output.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3238**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1791**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 291**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1078**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1791**], the
     Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.
     
     CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  40 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%; 1 mg Versed and 50 mcg of
     fentanyl intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic
     monitoring for conscious sedation.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was explained to the patient and informed
     consent was obtained.  Initially, contrast material was injected through the
     existing 8-French catheter which demonstrated opacification of the biliary
     tree, cystic duct, and duodenum, and therefore no obstruction of the catheter.
      The side holes were demonstrated to be in the appropriate position.  The
     radiographic appearance of the catheter is also identical to that of the time
     of placement on [**2777-12-12**]. Due to problems with leakage around the catheter,
     the tube was removed over an Amplatz guide wire, and exchanged for a 10-French
     pigtail catheter.  The locking loop mechanism was formed in the second portion
     of the duodenum, and injection of contrast demonstrates communication of the
     biliary tree with the duodenum. The tube was placed to external drainage
     according to the patient's wishes. The tube was secured to the patient's skin
     using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrack.
     
     FINDINGS:  Images obtained of the previously placed 8-French nephrostomy tube
     demonstrate the catheter to be in identical position relative to the previous
     study of [**2777-12-12**].  Images obtained following placement of the new 10-French
     catheter demonstrate the catheter to be entering from a right hepatic duct,
     coursing through the common hepatic bile duct, with the locking loop
     projecting over the duodenum.  There is opacification of the biliary tree,
     cystic duct, gallbladder and portions of duodenum.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     HISTORY: Upper GI bleed, metastatic renal cell cancer eroding duodenum.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis are obtained after the
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray per fast bolus technique.
     
     Comparison with prior CT from [**2777-11-20**].
     
     There has been interval increase in the size of the bilateral pleural
     effusions, the left greater than the right, with an associated moderate-sized
     left basilar consolidation.  There has been interval placement of a trans-
     hepatic drain as well as several stents traversing the porta hepatis region.
     No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder is partially
     distended.  Again seen is splenomegaly, slightly increased compared to the
     prior examination.
     
     Again seen is a large, heterogeneous mass, involving the porta hepatis and the
     lymph nodes in the periportal as well as mesenteric region.  The conglomerate
     mass of lymph nodes in the region of the porta hepatis compresses the second
     portion of the duodenum and displaces it laterally.  An active source of
     hemorrhage is not identified in the present examination.  The largest
     measurement previously obtained was 13.9 cm and it currently measures 15 cm.
     Also noted is occlusion of the portal vein and splenic vein with multiple
     collaterals and cavernous transformation. There are stable perisplenic
     varices, gallbladder wall varices, splenorenal shunts, and varices in the
     gastric wall.  The azygous and hemiazygous are prominent. There are filling
     defects in the infrarenal portion of the inferior vena cava and extending to
     the iliac bifurcation and right common femoral vein. Metastatic enlargement
     of the right adrenal gland again identified, as are enlarged retroperitoneal
     lymph nodes more inferiorly.
     
     The amount of ascites has slightly increased in the interval.  Loops of small
     bowel and large bowel are not dilated.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder and left ureter are normal.
     Again seen are prostatic calcifications.  There are minor degenerative changes
     in the spine.

     1. Large, conglomerate metastatic mass in the central upper retroperitoneum,
     centered at the SMA-celiac nodal complex, extending into the periportal region
     and compressing the second portion of the duodenum. The overall size is
     slightly increased compared to the prior examination, and there are a few
     areas that appear to be slightly more necrotic compared to the prior
     examination.  An active focus of hemorrhage is not identified. 
     
     2. Slight increase in the amount of ascites, as well as the bilateral pleural
     effusions and bibasilar areas of consoidation.
     
     3. Stable occlusion of the portal vein with cavernous transformation and
     multiple collaterals, as well as varices.  There is a new filling defect in
     the infrarenal IVC and extending to the iliac bifurcation.  Findings were
     discussed with medical and surgical team.
