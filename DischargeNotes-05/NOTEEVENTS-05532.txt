     There is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in right interlobar
     artery.  The endotracheal tube is approximately 2.5 cm proximal to carina. The

Admit Note
  Pt is a 77 yo who was known to have small infrarenal AAA from previous admissions. Has been living at a nursing home since last admission to hospital for a fall when she fractured hip, for safety concerns and rehab. Today pt rushed to OSH with ruptured AAA and medflighted to [**Hospital1 **]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 340**] preformed AAA repair. Intraop pt was labile and Vtach arrested x 1min. Resusitated with epi, lido, calcium and sodium bicarb. pt had EBL 2000cc with 4500c PRBCs, cell [**Doctor Last Name 341**], 3L crystalloid, cryoprecipitate and FFP. Pt brought to ICU postop.
 
Pt arrived on propofol. As time progressed pt still not responding to pain and at 1700 propofol off. Still without reflexes and movement. At 1830 pt noted to have cough and corneals. Pupils NR. Team aware.
 Vent rate decreased. Freq ABGs per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 342**] orders. Lungs clear with diminished LLL. Suction but no secrtions.

  Cv status very labile. gaol SBP<120 and HR in 70s. Pt very sensitive to fluid boluses, esmolol and nipride. Hypotensive at times but responds quickly to fluid only SBP >120s, then need to start gtts. Requiring freq titration. CO 1.19, wedge 6 and CVP 4 and pt recieved fluid with last CO 1.9, cvp 13 and wedge 15. UO total for last 4 hours 19cc. HO aware. INR 1.6 and low platelet count. Recieved 1 bag plts and 2u FFP with repeat INR 1.5 and plts in 130s. HCT 31. No DP or PT pulses and RLE had been mottled. Poor cap refill. Weakly palp popiteals and fm pulses. Insulin gtt titrated for tight BG control.

  GI/GU- Abd firm and distended without BS. OGT to LWS with no output. 
Midline incision with DSD intact and scant bloody drainage. Foley patent.

Social- Daughter in to visit and called at shift change. Updated on pt condition.

 Plan- Tight BP and HR control. Fluid resusitation and freq neuro exam until pt responsive.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  Status post AAA repair with difficulty arousing from surgery,
     evaluate for edema or CVA.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the head were obtained without IV
     contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is white and [**Doctor Last Name 20**] matter hypodensity in the territory of the
     left anterior cerebral artery consistent with chronic/previous infarction.
     There is white matter hypodensity in the right frontal lobe with extension to
     the [**Doctor Last Name 20**] matter.  There is a round hypodensity in the left basal ganglia
     consistent with a lacunar infarct.  There are multiple areas of hypodensity in
     the right and left cerebellum consistent with infarcts, age indeterminate.
     There is ventricular white matter hypodensity that may represent sequela of
     chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  There are basal ganglia
     calcifications.  No hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures is
     noted.  The basal cisterns appear patent.  The patient is intubated with
     opacification of the nasopharynx as well as mucosal thickening of the ethmoid
     sinuses noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Chronic left anterior cerebral artery infarction.
     2.  Multiple areas of hypodensity in both cerebellar hemispheres consistent
     with infarction, age indeterminant.
     3.  Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe with extension to the [**Doctor Last Name 20**] matter,
     consistent with infarction, favor subacute to chronic.
     4.  Lacunar infarct in the left basal ganglia.
     
     If there is continued clinical concern for acute infarction, an MRI scan with
     diffusion-weighted images may be considered.
     
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The left anterior cerebral artery infarction
     is subacute. There is effacement of sulci, and local mass effect, with no
     tissue loss. Therefore, this is not a chronic infarct. These findings were
     discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11962**] 0n [**3027-3-23**].

     Since the previous exam, there has been engorgement of hilar pulmonary

Pt remains very labile post-op from emergent AAA repair.

Cardiac: Pt extremely labile yesterday eve into this AM. Multiple changes made to pt's med infusions, see flowsheet for thorough data. Pt with low CO/CI and elevated SVR with labile BP. Pt initially started on esmolol for rate control, nipride added to keep SBP <120. Per HO, Milrinone added in attempts to improve CO/CI, but after team spoke with cardiology, milrinone weaned to off. Esmolol weaned down, nipride continues at range of 3-5mcg/kg/min to keep SBP >120. 12 lead EKG obtained and reviewed by HO. Cardiac enzymes continue to be cycled, troponin up to 1.09. CO/CI sl imroved with aggressive fluid rescussitation, see carevue for values. Pt rec'd 2 U PRBCs and 1U FFP overnight, pt also started on albumin.  HR 90-100's, ST with occasional PVCs. Pedal pulses not dopplerable, HO aware. BLE remain cool, pale, intermittantly mottled. Weak femoral pulses easy to obliterate.

Neuro: Pt slowly beginning to wake, opens eyes to voice but does not follow commands. Pt noted to have some resistance with BUE during AM care. Pupils 4mm and reactive, impaired corneals, gag and cough. Pt started on fentanyl gtt at 25mcg/hr for post-op pain management.

Resp: Pt remains intubated and vented, CMV with rr 18, tv500 and FIO2 60. ABGs improved. Lungs diminished in bilat bases.See carevue for ABGs.

CV- Pt sr to st in low to 102. Bp initially treated with nipride to maintain SBP less than 130 and CI 2.0 with desired afterload reduction to decrease SVR. see flowsheet for hemodynamic #s. Changed to nicardapine in light of toxicity risk of nipride and cardiac benefit of nicardipine. Esmolol gtt at 100mcg/kg/min. ASA started due to + troponin. SVO2 50-60s. swan at 51cm.
