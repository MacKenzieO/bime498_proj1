Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2992**] 
Chief Complaint:
Lung mass.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lung biopsy on [**2804-3-25**].
Vertebroplasty

 
History of Present Illness:
88 year old male with a history of prostate cancer, CVA, DM2, 
CEA and COPD transferred to the medicine service for further 
evaluation of a lung mass. The patient was in his usual state of 
health until one month prior to admission when he developed 
upper extremity weakness, right more than left as well as 
bilateral shoulder pain and a cough. He was admitted to an OSH 
and was found to have a LLL infiltrate and was treated for 
pneumonia and COPD flare.  He also had a spine MRI which 
demonstrated a T1 compression fracture.  The patient was 
transitioned to rehabilitation.  At the rehab facility he 
continued to have upper extremity weakness and bilateral 
shoulder pain refractory to conservative measures.  MRI of his 
brain showing no significant change from his post-stroke MRI per 
report.  His R hand weakness progressed and he was sent from 
rehab back to the OSH where he again had a MRI of his C-spine 
which showed interval progression of the compression fracture 
with retropulsion of the posterior fragment into the upper 
thoracic cord.  Additionally, a soft tissue mass anterior to the 
vertebral body brought up the possibility of metastatic disease. 
 His PSA remained flat at this time and a CT chest showed 2 LLL 
masses along with renal and thyroid cysts.  He was started on 
steroids and  sent to [**Hospital1 83**] for further managment.  
Incidentally, he was restarted on CTX/gentamycin at the OSH per 
family report because he developed fevers but they denied any 
other infectious symptoms at this time including SOB, cough, 
dysuria, or abdominal pain.  He did have mild diarrhea.  
.
At [**Hospital1 83**], his films were reviewed by neurosurgery and no cord 
compression was noted.  His thoracic vertebral fracture was 
thought to be stable and he was fitted for a brace.  IP was 
consulted to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass and CT of 
the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed.  A bone scan and 
CT head were ordered along with a MRI of C5-T4.  The patient was 
transfered to medicine for further work-up of his lung mass once 
acute neurosurgical issues were excluded.  
.
On interview today, the patient feels generally well.  He denies 
any CP, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or headache.  He 
does have some LE paresthesias and notes weakness in his R hand 
that is worse than baseline.  His family notes chronically loose 
bowels but states this has been worse of late and feels that his 
cognition has slipped over the past month.

Pertinent Results:
At the time of callout from the MICU ([**2804-3-27**]):
.  
Labs: Remarkable for WBC 18.3 trending downward, Hct 27.9 
baseline 32, INR 1.3.
.  
MR thoracic and cervical spine without contrast ([**2804-3-22**]): 1. 
Again seen is compression deformity involving the T1 vertebral 
body. There  
is no evidence of cord signal abnormality. Degenerative changes 
within the cervical spine result in areas of spinal canal 
stenosis, as described above. 2. There is left pleural effusion 
and ill-defined mass in left lower lobe, which is better 
evaluated on prior CT scans.  
.  
Bone Scan ([**2804-3-23**]): No evidence of osseous metastatic disease. 
Focal uptake in the lower neck likely correlates with T1 
compression fracture on CT scan.  
.  
CT chest/abd/pelvis ([**2804-3-21**]):  
1. Multiple heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue masses within 
the posterior left lung likely centering within the pleura 
extending into the lateral chest wall and causing mild bony 
erosion. A small linear calcification is noted adjacent to the 
pleura within the dominant mass suggesting possible 
mesothelioma. Additional diagnoses within the differential 
include primary lung cancer or metastatic lesion from thyroid or 
renal cell carcinoma. The lesion appears to be amenable to 
percutaneous biopsy. 2. Heterogeneously enhancing middle 
mediastinal left thyroid lesion. This likely represents a simple 
goiter but can be further evaluated with ultrasound if 
clinically indicated. 3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of 
acute cholecystitis. 4. Multiple right renal hypoattenuating 
lesions, some of which are clearly cystic and others which are 
too small to characterize. 5. Diffuse atherosclerotic 
calcifications. 6. T1 compression fracture with multilevel 
degenerative changes throughout the spine, including grade 1 
anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and mild posterior disc protrusion 
of L3-4 intervertebral disc.  
.  
Bronchial brushings and washings ([**2804-3-25**]): Negative for 
malignant cells.
.
Lymph node biopsy ([**2804-3-25**]): Non-diagnostic, lymph node not 
sampled, likely reactive lymphocytes.
.
Echo ([**2804-3-26**]): The left atrium is elongated. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic 
function is grossly preserved although views are technically 
suboptimal (EF probably >45%). Regional wall motion could not be 
fully assessed. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall  
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is mild 
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The  
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  
.
CXR ([**2804-3-26**]): Large lower lobe consolidation.  This may be due 
to aspiration, hemorrhage, or pneumonia. 
.
CXR ([**2804-3-27**]): Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs 
is new when compared to the previous chest radiograph and CT.  
The finding represents mild pulmonary edema. Previously 
identified bilateral lower lobe opacities are much less 
conspicuous on the current exam. Deviation of the trachea from 
the midline to the right attributable to the previously seen 
enlarged thyroid. 
.
CTA ([**2804-3-26**]): 1.  No pulmonary embolism. 2.  New bilateral 
pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right. 
3. Consolidation of the majority of the right lower lobe.  
Increased 
consolidation surrounding the left lower lobe masses.  This may 
be infectious or due to aspiration. 4.  No short interval change 
in the left lower lobe masses previously detailed on the study 
from five days ago. 
.
TTE [**2804-3-28**]: The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is 
grossly preserved although views are technically suboptimal (EF 
probably >45%). Regional wall motion could not be fully 
assessed. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
.
Thyroid Ultrasound:  1) Very limited study due to overlying 
brace and patient immobility. Thyroid parenchyma not visualized.
2) 4.1-cm mass centered in the expected position of the upper 
lobe of the left thyroid/supraclavicular region. It is 
impossible to tell on the current study whether this lesion is 
exophytic from the left lobe thyroid or represents 
supraclavicular adenopathy, though the former appears more 
likely in correlation with the recent CTA chest.
.
Noncontrast CT Chest:
1. No change in large soft tissue mass in the left lower lobe 
with extension/invasion into adjacent chest wall, pleural 
effusion, and infrahilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

2. Decreased right pleural effusion and improved right basilar 
atelectasis/consolidation.
.
CT Head ([**4-7**]) for mental status changes: 
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.

2. Old bilateral basal ganglia and left cerebellar infarcts.
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. T1 compression fracture: the patient was initially evaulated 
by neurosurgery who did not feel that the patient had new 
weakness or evidence of spinal cord compression. He was fitted 
for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5038**] brace which he wore at all times. In an effort to 
free the patient from the brace and improve his pain, he 
underwent interventional radiology-vertebroplasty. After that, 
the patient was able to be changed to a small soft collar, but 
had very little palliation from the procedure.  His mobility is 
significantly limited and requires significant assistance to get 
out of bed. At discharge, he could move all extremities at his 
baseline.  Radiation oncology was involved and radiated his T1 
lesion in a single fraction, with little palliation.  Tissue 
biopsy at the time of vertebroplasty was unrevealing.
.
2. LLL mass: likely primary lung cancer, however, no definitive 
tissue pathology was obtained despite several attempts including 
transbronchial biopsy.  DDx included thyroid and renal cell 
cancers, and the patient does have a large thyroid nodule which 
was unable to be biopsied secondary to his neck fracture 
constraints. Oncology consulted who thought patient was not a 
chemotherapy candidate given his solitary kidney and poor 
performance status. Radiation oncology consulted, as above.  He 
was not a candidate for radiation to the lung mass.
.
3. Post obstructive pneumonia: The patient was intermittently 
febrile throughout the hospitalization and was found to have a 
postobstructive pneumonia.  He was treated with broad spectrum 
antibiotics for a prolonged course given his inability to clear 
secretions effectively. Chest PT was not able to be done given 
the constraints of his neck fracture. On the day of discharge, 
he was febrile to 102 after a long period of being afebrile with 
a resolving leukocytosis.  He was continued on antibiotics at 
discharge.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: the patient developed new onset atrial 
fibrillation during the hospitalization around the time of his 
transbronchial biopsy.  He was diltiazem refractory and 
ultimately responded to IV Metoprolol. He was maintained on 
Metoprolol orally during the hospitalization.  He received a 
course of Amiodarone and coverted to sinus rhythm.  He was 
discharged on 200 mg Amiodarone daily in NSR.
.
5. Hypoxia: the patient was intermittently hypoxic during the 
initial period of his hospitalization from the large LLL mass, 
post obstructive pneumonia/mucus plugging, paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation and intermittent volume overload.  He would have a 
tendency to desaturate overnight, but would respond to increased 
oxygen and diuresis if overloaded.  At discharge, the patient 
had a much improved requirement  of 2 liters by nasal cannula.  
.
6. Left Lobe Thyroid Nodule. Incidentally found on chest CT on 
[**2804-3-20**]. Normal thyroid function. Thyroid ultrasound completed, 
but limited by the patient's large neck brace and T1 fracture.  
The decision was made not to pursue further characterization of 
the thyroid nodule.
.  
7. Anemia of chronic inflammation: stable at his baseline 
hematocrit of 28-30.    
.  
8. Prostate cancer: prior history, on Zoladex as outpatient. Not 
continued as inpatient. PSA flat despite evidence of metastatic 
disease.  Stable as inpatient. 
.  
9. Diabetes: home regimen of metformin and glipizide held in the 
hospital, placed on sliding scale.  Uncontrolled sugars in the 
setting of steroids for pain control.  Titrating Lantus based on 
sliding scale requirement.   
.
10. Pain and Palliation: Palliative care consulted given that 
the patient's pain was difficult to control.  He was refractory 
to Tylenol but very sensitive to narcotics.  He was on several 
regimens during the hospitalization, but was ultimately 
discharged on Methadone 0.5 mg q8 am and q2 pm.  He was also 
maintained on Ritalin for improved mood and energy during the 
day.  He was also pulsed with Decadron with improvement in his 
mood, but not pain. Decadron was tapered to 4 mg daily with the 
plan to taper off as tolerated.
.
11.  Glaucoma: continued home Latanoprost
.
12. Gout: continued home allopurinol. No acute issues.
.
13. Hypertension: well controlled initially on home regimen, but 
became difficult to control in the setting of steroids. At 
discharge, he was stable in 130s/70s on Lisinopril and 
Metoprolol. 
.  
14. Disposition: the patient had a long and complicated hospital 
course, ultimately resulting in vertebroplasy for his T1 
compression fracture. He was deconditioned and depressed at the 
time of discharge to hospice.  Palliative care followed closely 
in the management of this patient and helped the family cope 
with the new diagnosis and complications.  Ultimately it was 
decided not to pursue aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures and the patient was discharged to hospice care.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Pneumonia, rule out pneumonia.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
     
     There is a large (7.5 cm) opacity in the left lower lobe posteriorly.  It
     abuts the posterior chest wall and may obscure a portion of the posterior
     diaphragm.  No gross effusion is identified.  Heart size is at the upper
     limits of normal.  No CHF, other focal opacity, or effusion is identified. The
     hilar and mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for age.
     
     Narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance in the right shoulder is compatible
     with a chronic complete rotator cuff tear. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Focal opacity in the left lower lobe posteriorly.  In appropriate clinical
     setting, this could represent an atypical presentation of pneumonia. However,
     given the relatively discrete rounded appearance on the frontal view, the
     possibility of a focal lung mass should be considered.  As a result, short-
     term followup to resolution or, alternatively, a chest CT is recommended for
     further assessment.  Rounded atelectasis is considered much less likely given
     the absence of diffuse pleural abnormalities.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  T1 compression fracture.  Please image.
     
     There are no prior studies for comparison.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the cervical spine were obtained
     without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were generated.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a compression fracture
     of the T1 vertebral body as described.  There is relatively equivalent loss of
     height throughout the vertebral body.  No definite retropulsed fragments are
     seen.  Vacuum phenomenon is seen within this vertebral body.  There is also a
     fracture through the left lamina at the T1 level.  The coronal reformatted
     images demonstrate this fracture through an oval area of relative
     demineralization.
     
     No additional fractures are identified.  The cervical and upper thoracic
     vertebral body heights, excluding T1, are maintained.  There is intervertebral
     disc space narrowing at multiple levels, greatest at C6/7 and in the proximal
     thoracic spine.  The prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  The CT does
     not provide intrathecal detail comparable to that of MRI, the central spinal
     canal appears narrowed at multiple levels, related to disc osteophyte
     complexes indenting the ventral thecal sac.  These are noted at C3/4, C4/5 and
     C5/6.
     
     Soft tissue window images demonstrate a large round lesion of the left lobe of
     the thyroid at the thoracic inlet.  This lesion measures 4.4 x 3.5 cm in
     greatest axial dimensions.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the
     aortic arch and carotid arteries.  There are several small lymph nodes of the

     (Cont)
     fracture through the left T1 lamina courses through a rounded area of
     demineralization or lucency, raising the possibility of an underlying bone
     lesion at this locale.  This fracture may be unstable given that the vertebral
     body and posterior elements are involved.
     2.  Large rounded opacity in the left lower lobe of the lung, partially
     imaged.  While this could represent a rounded pneumonia, a neoplasm is also
     considered and dedicated chest CT is recommended.
     3.  Large rounded lesion of the left lobe of the thyroid.  This should be
     further evaluated with ultrasound.
     4.  Advanced atherosclerotic disease.

     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior CT spine examination dated [**2804-3-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
     to the pubic symphysis with oral and intravenous contrast.  Three-minute delay
     images were obtained per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
     displayed with 5-mm slice thickness and used for better anatomic localization
     of disease.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A large heterogeneously enhancing
     left posterior lung soft tissue mass measuring approximately 8.2 x 4.9 cm
     (series 3, image 33) is identified and appears to contain a well-defined
     circular punctate calcification (likley sequela of old granulomatous disease)
     as well as an additional thin linear calcification noted more laterally
     abutting the pleura. The exact origin of the mass is unclear, however, it
     looks to be centered either within the pleural space itself or the lung and is
     noted to extend into the chest wall and cause mild erosion into the
     surrounding ribs. Additionally, two other foci of enhancing soft tissue masses
     are noted adjacently, one abutting the lateral chest wall pleura measuring
     approximately 1.8 x 2.3 cm and an additional more rounded mass adjacent to the
     descending aorta measuring approximately 3 x 3.9 cm. Additionally, on coronal
     images (series 400B, image 53), there appears to be increased pleural
     thickening without calcification noted slightly more superior to the dominant
     mass.  The lung parenchyma appears otherwise unremarkable with no other focal
     nodules identified.  There is minor dependent atelectasis within the base of
     the right lobe.  Airways appear patent to the subsegmental level and other
     than coronary and aortic vascular calcifications, the heart and great vessels
     appear normal. No axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy is identified and there is
     mild scattered mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the largest conglomerate of nodes
     measuring approximately 1.2 x 2.9 cm in the subcarinal area which contains a
     punctate calcification.  A heterogeneously enhancing 3.7 x 3.8 cm left thyroid
     mass is again identified as demonstrated on prior CT spine.  It does appear to
     cause mild rightward deviation of the trachea.

     display several small punctate calcifications scattered throughout the liver,
     spleen, and right kidney parenchyma likely related to sequela of prior
     granulomatous disease.  No focal liver masses are identified and the portal
     vein appears patent.  There is evidence of cholelithiasis, without signs of
     acute cholecystitis.  The spleen, pancreas, stomach, and adrenal glands all
     appear unremarkable.  The patient is noted to be status post left nephrectomy.
     Multiple hypoattenuating lesions are identified within the right kidney, some
     too small to characterize and some which are clearly cystic.  One lesion
     measures approximately 2.2 x 1.5 cm extending off the medial right upper pole
     likely representing a hyperdense cyst, with another larger simple cyst
     measuring approximately 5.3 x 7.9 cm likely extending off the interpolar
     region of the right kidney.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.  There is no free air or free
     fluid noted within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The intrapelvic bowel, prostate,
     and urinary bladder appear grossly normal.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic
     or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  No free fluid is noted within the
     pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions are
     identified.  Previously noted compression fracture of T1 is noted on sagittal
     images.  Additionally, there are multilevel degenerative changes of the spine
     with degenerative disc disease as well as grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
     Remaining vertebral body heights appear well preserved.  Additionally, as
     noted above, there appears to be mild cortical erosion of the left posterior
     ninth rib with possible involvement of the posterior eighth rib as well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue masses within the posterior
     left lung likely centering within the lung extending into the lateral chest
     wall and causing mild bony erosion. A small linear calcification is noted
     adjacent to the pleura within the dominant mass.  Likley reprsenets a primary
     lung carcinoma, with mesothelioma or metastatic lesion from thyroid or renal
     cell carcinoma also within the differential. The lesion appears to be amenable
     to percutaneous biopsy.
     
     2. Heterogeneously enhancing middle mediastinal left thyroid lesion.  This
     likely represents a simple goiter but can be further evaluated with ultrasound
     if clinically indicated.
     
     3.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
     
     4.  Multiple right renal hypoattenuating lesions, some of which are clearly

     display several small punctate calcifications scattered throughout the liver,
     spleen, and right kidney parenchyma likely related to sequela of prior
     granulomatous disease.  No focal liver masses are identified and the portal
     vein appears patent.  There is evidence of cholelithiasis, without signs of
     acute cholecystitis.  The spleen, pancreas, stomach, and adrenal glands all
     appear unremarkable.  The patient is noted to be status post left nephrectomy.
     Multiple hypoattenuating lesions are identified within the right kidney, some
     too small to characterize and some which are clearly cystic.  One lesion
     measures approximately 2.2 x 1.5 cm extending off the medial right upper pole
     likely representing a hyperdense cyst, with another larger simple cyst
     measuring approximately 5.3 x 7.9 cm likely extending off the interpolar
     region of the right kidney.  No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified.  There is no free air or free
     fluid noted within the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The intrapelvic bowel, prostate,
     and urinary bladder appear grossly normal.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic
     or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  No free fluid is noted within the
     pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions are
     identified.  Previously noted compression fracture of T1 is noted on sagittal
     images.  Additionally, there are multilevel degenerative changes of the spine
     with degenerative disc disease as well as grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.
     Remaining vertebral body heights appear well preserved.  Additionally, as
     noted above, there appears to be mild cortical erosion of the left posterior
     ninth rib with possible involvement of the posterior eighth rib as well.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Multiple heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue masses within the posterior
     left lung likely centering within the lung extending into the lateral chest
     wall and causing mild bony erosion. A small linear calcification is noted
     adjacent to the pleura within the dominant mass.  Likley reprsenets a primary
     lung carcinoma, with mesothelioma or metastatic lesion from thyroid or renal
     cell carcinoma also within the differential. The lesion appears to be amenable
     to percutaneous biopsy.
     
     2. Heterogeneously enhancing middle mediastinal left thyroid lesion.  This
     likely represents a simple goiter but can be further evaluated with ultrasound
     if clinically indicated.
     
     3.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
     
     4.  Multiple right renal hypoattenuating lesions, some of which are clearly
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPARISON:  CT scan from [**2804-3-20**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained of the
     cervical and thoracic spine.
     
     MR [**Name13 (STitle) 948**]:  Again seen is a compression deformity seen involving T1, with
     increased STIR signal abnormality, and slight retropulsion of the posterior
     disc fragment.  There is severe spinal canal narrowing at the C3-4 and C4-5
     levels, with central disc bulge and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum.
     Additionally, there is mild stenosis of C5-6 and C6-7.  At the level of the
     compression deformity, there is mild canal narrowing.  There is no evidence of
     cord signal abnormality or epidural hematoma.  There are no significant
     prevertebral soft tissue fluid collections identified.  Again seen is a large
     heterogeneous mass within the left lobe of the thyroid, seen on the prior
     study.
     
     MR [**Name13 (STitle) 949**]:  No fractures are identified within the remaining thoracic
     vertebral bodies.  There is no evidence of any other areas of subluxation. The
     signal intensity of the thoracic spinal cord is normal in appearance. There is
     no intracanalicular hematoma.  There is a well-rounded approximately 1-cm
     hyperintense T2 focus consistent with a perineural cyst at the level of the
     right T7 vertebral body.  Again seen is a small left pleural effusion and ill-
     defined mass within the left lobe, which is better evaluated on prior CT
     scans.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Again seen is compression deformity involving the T1 vertebral body. There
     is no evidence of cord signal abnormality.  Degenerative changes within the
     cervical spine result in areas of spinal canal stenosis, as described above.
     2.  There is left pleural effusion and ill-defined mass in left lower lobe,
     which is better evaluated on prior CT scans.

     INTERPRETATION:    
       
     Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior  
     projections.  
       
     There is focally increased uptake in the lower neck which likely corresponds to
     a T1 compression fracture on CT scan.    
       
     There is mildly increased uptake in the region of the sacrum and sacroiliac
     joints which correspond to degenerative changes on CT scan.    
       
     There is liner uptake in the soft tissue of the medial thighs which correlates
     with heavily calcified vessels on CT scan.  
       
     The left kidney and distal left 12th rib are surgically absent.  
       
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.  Focal uptake in the
     lower neck likely correlates with T1 compression fracture on CT scan.

     AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  No pneumothorax is identified on this
     semi-upright chest x-ray.  Previously noted left lower lobe mass is now
     paritally obscured, likley due to surrounding hemorrhage. A 7 mm calcification
     associated with the lesion on prior CT, is again noted.  Minimal interstitial
     thickening bilaterally is likely related to mild volume overload. The
     cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature
     is not engorged. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  The surrounding
     soft tissue and osseous structures demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes

     fibrillation and hypoxia and concern for PE.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2804-3-21**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the chest were
     obtained, pre and post-rapid bolus of 100 mL Optiray IV contrast with coronal
     and sagittal reformats.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels of
     the chest including pulmonary arteries opacify well.  There is no evidence of
     pulmonary embolism.  There are extensive atherosclerotic changes of the aorta
     but no acute pathology.  There are new bilateral pleural effusions, moderate
     on the left and small on the right. There is new opacity of the majority of
     the right lower lobe and surrounding the left lower lobe masses, probably a
     combination of consolidation and atelectasis.  There has been no significant
     short interval change in size of the left lower lobe masses.  Also unchanged
     is mediastinal lymphadenopathy and heterogeneous left thyroid enlargement.
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen redemonstrates cholelithiasis and a
     right kidney stone.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Again demonstrated is the compression fracture at T1 and
     multilevel degenerative changes.  There is erosion of left-sided ribs by the
     left lower lobe masses.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        88 year old man with with recent trauma and T1 fx. s/p bronch on [**2804-3-25**] and  
      desat, change in mental status, rigors afterwards. Has known LLL mass, new R

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  T1 fracture.  Assess interval change.  Single portable radiograph of
     the chest demonstrates no change in the cardiomediastinal contour when
     compared with [**2804-3-26**].  Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs is
     noted.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  The trachea is midline. 
     The aorta is calcified.  The bilateral lower lobe opacities seen on the chest
     radiograph of [**2804-2-24**] and subsequent CT examination are much less
     conspicuous on the current study.  There is deviation of the trachea from the
     midline to the right attributable to the enlarged thyroid seen on recent CT
     examination.  No pneumothorax.  There is increased airspace opacity involving
     both lungs, new when compared to the previous chest radiograph.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Increased airspace opacity involving both lungs is new when compared to the
     previous chest radiograph and CT.  The finding represents mild pulmonary
     edema.
     
     Previously identified bilateral lower lobe opacities are much less conspicuous
     on the current exam.
     
     Deviation of the trachea from the midline to the right attributable to the

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      88 year old man with afib w/rvr, and thyroid nodule and lung masses.            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Possible thyroid cancer?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  80-year-old with afib and lung masses, evaluate thyroid nodule
     seen on recent CT.
     
     THYROID ULTRASOUND:  Compared to CTA chest of [**2804-3-26**].  Due to a recent
     thoracic vertebral fracture, imaging of the thyroid is very limited.  Per the
     ordering team, the brace was removed, however, the patient could not move
     during the exam to aid imaging.  Allowing for this, the thyroid parenchyma is
     not well visualized.  In the region of the upper pole of the left thyroid/left
     supraclavicular region, there is a well-circumscribed 4.1 x 3.0 heterogeneous
     mass.  It is impossible to determine on this examination whether this mass is
     exophytic from the left lobe of the thyroid or represents a distinct
     supraclavicular adenopathy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Very limited study due to overlying brace and patient immobility.  Thyroid
     parenchyma not visualized.
     2) 4.1-cm mass centered in the expected position of the upper lobe of the left
     thyroid/supraclavicular region.  It is impossible to tell on the current study
     whether this lesion is exophytic from the left lobe thyroid or represents
     supraclavicular adenopathy, though the former appears more likely in
     correlation with the recent CTA chest.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  88-year-old man with pneumonia and poor venous access, requiring
     intravenous antibiotics.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PICC line placement under fluoroscopic guidance.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2198**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2199**] and Dr.
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**] [**Name (STitle) 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and
     supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Using ultrasound, the left basilic vein was found to
     be patent and compressible.  A pre-procedure timeout was performed to verify
     patient identity and the procedure to be performed.  The chosen site along the
     left upper arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Under
     direct ultrasound visualization, the left basilic vein was cannulated with a
     21-gauge needle, and a 0.018 guidewire passed into the superior vena cava.
     Hard copy ultrasound images were acquired before and after venous access,
     demonstrating patency. The needle was exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture
     sheath, and a 43- cm length single- lumen PICC line was advanced over the
     guidewire into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. Placement
     of the tip was verified via injection of 4 cc of Optiray-320. A final
     fluoroscopic spot image shows the PICC line to terminate in the superior vena
     cava.  The catheter was flushed, and the line secured to the adjacent skin
     with a StatLock device. There were no immediate complications. The patient
     tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of PICC line, via the left basilic vein,
     terminating in the superior vena cava.  Line ready for use.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Prostate cancer.  Left lower lobe lung mass.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast images through the chest.  
     
     Comparison was made with CTs on [**2804-3-26**] and [**2804-3-21**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large heterogeneous mass within the left lower lobe
     measuring approximately 8 x 5 cm, which is unchanged in appearance, and better
     characterized on the prior contrast-enhanced CTs.  This mass contains a coarse
     calcification, likely an engulfed granuloma.  There is thickening of the left
     lower lobe bronchial posterior wall, as well as a large left infrahilar lymph
     node mass adjacent to the inferior left pulmonary vein measuring approximately
     3.6 x 2.5 cm.  There is a stable moderate left pleural effusion, as well as
     calcified left pleural plaques.  There is extension of the soft tissue mass
     into the left lateral chest wall, with erosion of the left eighth and ninth
     ribs. There are multiple subcentimeter prevascular and paratracheal lymph
     nodes as previously described.  There is a 1.1 cm lower left paratracheal
     lymph node. Calcifications are noted within the subcarinal nodal mass.  There
     is a stable heterogeneous left thyroid mass measuring 3.6 x 3.7 cm, deviating
     the trachea to the right.
     
     Compared with the prior study, there is interval decrease in size in the small
     right pleural effusion, as well as extent of the right lower lobe basilar
     atelectasis/consolidation.
     
     There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch and great vessels,
     as well as descending thoracic aorta and ascending aorta.  There are mitral
     annular calcifications, as well as coronary artery calcifications.  A right
     subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the distal superior vena
     cava.
     
     Limited views of the abdomen demonstrate multiple splenic and liver calcified
     granulomas, as well as cholelithiasis, extensive atherosclerotic vascular
     calcifications, as well as a punctate calcification in the upper pole of the
     right kidney.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 88 y/o man with history of prostate carcinoma with T1 compression
     fracture. History of severe back pain. Patient refractory to conservative
     medical management. 
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1808**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **], the Attending Neuroradiologist, present
     and supervising throughout the entire procedure.
     
     Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
     explaining the risks, indications, and alternative management in extensive
     detail. Patient clearly understood the risks and benefits and alternatives of
     the procedure and willfully consented to the procedure.
     
     The patient was brought to the fluoroscopy suite and placed on the table in
     the prone position. MAC anesthesia was administered. The lower back was
     prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Initially, using 22 gauge
     spinal needles under local anesthesia with aseptic precautions, the needle was
     placed in the region of both pedicles. Using AP & lateral views, 11 gauge
     needles were then placed through both pedicles into the T1 vertebral body.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance, approximately 1 cc of PMMA (PRLX) . At this
     point, it was decided to terminate this exam as end point of the procedure and
     the needles were removed.
     
     Patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was sent to the floor with
     orders. 1 gm of IV Ancef was administered prior to the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful vertebroplasty of the T1 vertebral body by the
     transpedicular approach.

     INDICATION:  88-year-old man with known lung cancer, status post
     vertebroplasty.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2804-3-22**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.
     
     FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline
     structures, or major vascular territorial infarct.  There is age appropriate
     involution change.  The [**Doctor Last Name 20**]- white matter differentiation is preserved. Again
     seen are chronic appearing lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia and thalami.
     There are dense basal ganglia calcifications bilaterally. Retention
     cysts/polyps are seen in the maxillary sinuses.  Again seen is a focal left
     cerebellar encephalomalacia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     2.  Old bilateral basal ganglia and left cerebellar infarcts.
     
     MRI with gadolinium is more sensitive in the detection of metastatic disease.
