     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man status post fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the head were obtained
     without IV contrast.  Bone algorithm images were also obtained.
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is extensive diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as
     well as small bilateral convexity subdural hematomas.  There are large
     bilateral frontal parenchymal hemorrhages, which on the right extends into the
     right lateral ventricle.  There is associated shift of normally midline
     structures to the left, indicative of subfalcine herniation.  There is
     effacement of the basilar cisterns including the suprasellar cistern
     consistent with uncal herniation. There is fluid within the frontal, ethmoid,
     sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses. The soft tissues demonstrate a subgaleal
     hematoma of the occipital region. Bone windows demonstrate a comminuted skull
     base fracture involving the right side of the foramen magnum and extending
     into the mastoid portion of the right temporal bone as well as into the
     occipital bone superiorly.  This fracture involves the right jugular foramen.
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid, subdural, frontal parenchymal and
     intraventricular hemorrhages as described.
     
     2.  Subfalcine herniation to the left.  Effacement of basilar cisterns
     including the suprasellar cistern consistent with uncal herniation.
     
     3.  Comminuted skull base fracture involving the right foramen magnum
     extending superiorly into the occiput as well as into the mastoid portion of
     the right temporal bone and involving the right jugular foramem.
     
     4.  Subgaleal hematoma of the occipital region.

     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man status post fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the cervical spine were
     obtained in soft tissue and bone algorithms.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
     images were also obtained.
     
     CT OF THE C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  As previously reported on head CT of
     [**2827-6-29**], again identified is the right skull base fracture involving
     the right foramen magnum and extending into the mastoid portion of the right
     temporal bone as well as extending superiorly into the occipital bone.  This
     comminuted fracture may involve the right jugular foramen.
     
     C1 through C7 are well visualized and there is no evidence of cervical spine
     fracture.  There is minimal grade 1 anterolisthesis of C6 over C7.  There are
     moderate degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine including disc
     space narrowing at C4/5 and C5/6 with associated posterior osteophytes at
     these locations.  There is no encroachment of the spinal canal.  Also noted
     are proliferative changes of the facet joints. The patient is intubated.  The
     prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  Please note that CT is not as
     sensitive as MRI for intrathecal detail.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Skull base fracture as described.
     2.  No evidence of cervical spine fracture.

     HISTORY:  Loss of consciousness, intracranial hemorrhage, fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis without IV
     contrast.  This was done because IV access was not available at the time of
     the CT scan.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The endotracheal tube is slightly low,
     abutting the left side of the trachea.  There are calcifications within the
     aortic arch, ascending, and descending aorta, as well as coronary artery
     calcifications.  Assessment of the aorta and pulmonary arteries is limited due
     to lack of IV contrast.  The heart is enlarged.  There are small bilateral
     pleural effusions.  There is no pericardial effusion.  Assessment of
     lymphadenopathy is limited due to lack of IV contrast.  There are multifocal
     areas of consolidation/collapse including the right upper, right lower, and
     left lower lobes.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Again assessment of the vasculature
     and traumatic organ injury is limited due to lack of IV contrast.  On this
     unenhanced scan, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal
     glands are unremarkable.  There is vascular calcification of the aorta.  The
     feeding tube terminates within the stomach.  There is bilateral perinephric
     stranding.  There is no definite free air or free fluid.  The large and small
     bowel is unremarkable.  Trace amounts of free fluid cannot be excluded to lack
     of IV contrast and patient motion.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter is within the bladder.
     The rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  There is a trace amount of
     free fluid within the pelvis.  Extensive vascular calcifications.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes without evidence of acute fractures.

     CT ORBIT, SELLA & IAC W/O CONTRAST                              Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 8776**]
     Reason: please do full craniofacila cuts                            
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      [**Age over 90 **] year old man with ICH s/p fall and liekly multiple skull/facial fractures    
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please do full craniofacila cuts                                                
     No contraindications for IV contrast

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male status post fall with concern for fracture.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT continuously acquired axial images of the orbits, sella, and
     internal auditory canals were obtained without IV contrast.  Soft tissue and
     bone algorithms were obtained as well as coronal and sagittal reformatted
     images.
     
     FINDINGS:  As previously described in the [**2827-6-29**] Head CT report
     there is a comminuted right skull base fracture involving the right foramen
     magnum and extending into the mastoid portion of the right temporal bone as
     well as extending superiorly into the occipital bone.  This fracture involves
     the right jugular foramen.  No other fractures are identified. The orbits and
     internal auditory canals are intact.  There is fluid within all of the
     paranasal sinuses, likely representing hemorrhage.  The patient is intubated.
     Regional soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Right skull base fracture as described.  No other fractures identified.
     2.  Fluid within the paranasal sinuses, likely representing hemorrhage.
     
     A wet read of the results of this study was posted to the ER dashboard at time
     8:50 p.m. [**2827-6-29**].
     
     Note added at attending review: The right foramen magnum fracture definitely
     does involve the right jugular foramen. There are possible fractures of the
     clivus and sphenoid sinus.

     TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS PORT)                                Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 8772**]
     Reason: TRAUMA

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Trauma.
     
     COMPARISON:  No previous studies.
     
     CHEST:  AP portable supine view.  The lung apices and superior mediastinum,
     including the superior aspect of the aortic knob, are not included on the
     image. Evaluation is further limited by the superimposed trauma board
     structures. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the
     carina.  The nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. There is no
     pleural effusion or evidence of a pneumothorax in supine position. An opacity
     is noted in the right mid lung zone.
     
     PELVIS:  AP supine portable view.  Evaluation is limited by the superimposed
     trauma board structures.  No fractures are identified.  Alignment appears
     normal on the single projection provided.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Lung apices and superior mediastinum not evaluated.
     2.  Right mid lung zone opacity.
     3.  No evidence of pelvic fracture on limited evaluation.
                                                                           DFDkq
