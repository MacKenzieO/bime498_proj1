Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo female with history of CAD, HTN, CHF and breast cancer 
admitted with melena.

1. UGIB- The patient presented with fatigue and melena. Her 
initial hematocrit was 26. An NG lavage in the ED did not clear 
with >1 liter saline. GI and surgery were consulted and 
recommended urgent EGD. Her initial EGD showed diffuse red blood 
in the fundus and body of the stomach with no identifiable 
source. She was then taken emergently to IR for angiography. 
Angiogram showed no obvious source of bleeding; however, the 
left gastric artery was prophylactically emoblized with gel 
foam. The patient subsequently had no further bleeding episodes 
and her hematocrit stablilized. Her aspirin was discontinued. 
She received a total of 4units of PRBCs and was started on 
protonix. An H.pylori was sent and is pending at the time of 
discharge. She had a re-look EGD on [**10-2**] which showed severe 
diffuse gastritis with contact bleeding. She will need 
outpatient GI follow-up. 
  
2. CAD: The patient denied chest pain however given her history 
of CAD she was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes. She 
had no events on telemetry. Her aspirin and beta blocker were 
held on admission; however, once her hematocrit stabilized her 
beta blocker was restarted.

3. HTN: Restarted on beta blocker.  

4. Depression: The patient was continued on celexa and remeron 
with trazadone prn at night.   

5. Access: 2 large bore IVs were maintained at all times. 

6. Px- Pneumoboots, PPI

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  87-year-old woman with a history of melena since yesterday. Presents
     to the ED this morning with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper
     GI endoscopy identified active bleeding in the fundus/body of the stomach, but
     was not able to control it with epinephrine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  Since the patient was sedated for previous endoscopy, informed
     consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's health proxy, her
     daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 350**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14709**]. The explanation of benefits and risks of the
     procedure and the consent were witnessed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right
     groin was prepared in sterile fashion.  Using the Seldinger technique, the
     right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19 gauge needle.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta.  After
     that, a 4 French sheath was introduced into the common femoral artery.  A 4
     French C2 Cobra catheter was advanced through the sheath into the abdominal
     aorta and was introduced into the celiac axis.  A selective celiac arteriogram
     was performed.  Then, a Renagade high flow microcatheter was advanced through
     the C2 into the celiac axis and the left gastric artery was accessed.  A
     superselective arteriogram of the left gastric artery was performed.
     Embolization of the left gastric artery was performed with 4 cc of gelfoam
     slurry.  A final superselective arteriogram of the left gastric artery was
     obtained as a post-embolization control.  Also, a selective arteriogram of the
     superior mesenteric artery was performed to rule-out any other branches
     supplying the stomach.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS: A diffuse vascular blush was seen over the stomach, however no
     active bleeding was seen on the angiograms. Decision was made to perform
     prophylactic embolization of the left gastric artery with gelfoam, based on
     the localization of the bleeding seen on the upper GI endoscopy.  The post-
     embolization arteriogram showed decreased flow into the branches arising from
     the left gastric artery as well as slow flow.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: There were no immediate complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Celiac and superior mesenteric artery selective arteriography with no
     angiographic evidence of active bleeding. Prophylactic embolization of the
     left gastric artery with gelfoam was successfully performed.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  87-year-old woman with a history of melena since yesterday. Presents
     to the ED this morning with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper
     GI endoscopy identified active bleeding in the fundus/body of the stomach, but
     was not able to control it with epinephrine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  Since the patient was sedated for previous endoscopy, informed
     consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's health proxy, her
     daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 350**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14709**]. The explanation of benefits and risks of the
     procedure and the consent were witnessed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right
     groin was prepared in sterile fashion.  Using the Seldinger technique, the
     right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19 gauge needle.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta.  After
     that, a 4 French sheath was introduced into the common femoral artery.  A 4
     French C2 Cobra catheter was advanced through the sheath into the abdominal
     aorta and was introduced into the celiac axis.  A selective celiac arteriogram
     was performed.  Then, a Renagade high flow microcatheter was advanced through
     the C2 into the celiac axis and the left gastric artery was accessed.  A
     superselective arteriogram of the left gastric artery was performed.
     Embolization of the left gastric artery was performed with 4 cc of gelfoam
     slurry.  A final superselective arteriogram of the left gastric artery was
     obtained as a post-embolization control.  Also, a selective arteriogram of the
     superior mesenteric artery was performed to rule-out any other branches
     supplying the stomach.

     HISTORY:  87-year-old woman with a history of melena since yesterday. Presents
     to the ED this morning with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper
     GI endoscopy identified active bleeding in the fundus/body of the stomach, but
     was not able to control it with epinephrine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.
     
     CONSENT:  Since the patient was sedated for previous endoscopy, informed
     consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's health proxy, her
     daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 350**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14709**]. The explanation of benefits and risks of the
     procedure and the consent were witnessed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right
     groin was prepared in sterile fashion.  Using the Seldinger technique, the
     right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19 gauge needle.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta.  After
     that, a 4 French sheath was introduced into the common femoral artery.  A 4
     French C2 Cobra catheter was advanced through the sheath into the abdominal
     aorta and was introduced into the celiac axis.  A selective celiac arteriogram
     was performed.  Then, a Renagade high flow microcatheter was advanced through
     the C2 into the celiac axis and the left gastric artery was accessed.  A
     superselective arteriogram of the left gastric artery was performed.
     Embolization of the left gastric artery was performed with 4 cc of gelfoam

     HISTORY:  87-year-old woman with a history of melena since yesterday. Presents
     to the ED this morning with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper
     GI endoscopy identified active bleeding in the fundus/body of the stomach, but
     was not able to control it with epinephrine.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3669**]
     [**Doctor Last Name 156**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising
     throughout the procedure.

     consent was obtained over the phone from the patient's health proxy, her
     daughter, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 350**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14709**]. The explanation of benefits and risks of the
     procedure and the consent were witnessed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. The right
     groin was prepared in sterile fashion.  Using the Seldinger technique, the
     right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19 gauge needle.  A 0.035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta.  After

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Patient with metastatic breast carcinoma.  Evaluate response to  
     therapy.  Restaging.
     
     METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 
     fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
     correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
     are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
     overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
     level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 124 mg/dL. The area
     imaged spanned the region from the base of the skull to the proximal thighs.
      
     Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
     images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
     determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
     implications regarding the significance of that uptake. 
     
     FINDINGS:  There are no prior PET-CT studies for comparison.
     
     There is focal abnormal radiotracer uptake in the right anterior 4th rib in an
     area of a lytic lesion on bone windows.  In addition, there is a focal
     radiotracer uptake in the right clavicular head with a maximum SUV of 3, which
     is suspicious for metastatic lesion.  There are focal areas of radiotracer
     uptake on image #47 and image #49, likely within T6 and T7 vertebral bodies,
     also worrisome for metastatic disease.
     
     There is mild, heterogeneous radiotracer uptake within the facet joints of the
     cervical spine, likely degenerative in nature.
     
     Below the diaphragm, there is focal uptake of radiotracer within the cecum.  The
     maximum SUV is approximately 11.7.  This is more concerning in the focality of
     its nature and intense radiotracer uptake for a lesion such as an adenoma.  A
     colonoscopy is suggested, if clinically indicated.
     
     CT images demonstrate a prior right mastectomy.  A calcified lesion is seen in
     the left breast.  There is a solid appearing left renal lesion.  There are other
     renal cysts identified.
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Evidence for skeletal metastases in the rib and vertebral body,
     as described above.  2) Focal uptake within the cecum, concerning for a possible
     adenoma, colonoscopy suggested if clinically indicated.  3) Solid appearing
     renal lesion with no abnormal radiotracer uptake should be followed by
     diagnostic and clinical criteria.

     CT scan of the brain before and after the administration of contrast.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement to suggest
     the presence of metastatic disease.  Some prominence of ventricles and sulci
     are consistent with mild brain atrophy.  There is no evidence of mass effect
     or hemorrhage.  There is no displacement of normally mid-line structures.
     There is no evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or a fluid collection.
     There is no definite evidence of calvarial metastatic disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Mild brain atrophy.  No evidence of metastatic disease.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Eighty-eight year old with h/o lobular breast cancer, post lumpectomy
     and radiation therapy.
     
     INTERPRETATION:  Whole body and spot views of the ribs demonstrate a focus of  
     increased tracer activity seen in the anterior 5th rib and the anterior 11th or
     12th left rib.  Increased linear tracer uptake is also seen in the T5 and T6
     vertebral bodies.  A low level of increased tracer uptake is also seen in both
     shoulder joints, both wrists, both knees, and both ankles, consistent with
     degenerative changes. 
     
     In comparison to the prior study of [**2618-4-2**], the previously seen areas of
     activity in the T12 vertebral body and left greater trochanter have resolved.
     
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with compression fracture of the T5 and T6
     vertebral bodies and fractures of the ribs, as described above.  The patient
     also states that she did fall in the recent past.  Resolution of activity seen
     in the T12 vertebral body suggests that this activity from the prior study was
     due to a compression fracture as well.  No definite evidence of metastatic
     disease on the current study though this is not completely excluded.
