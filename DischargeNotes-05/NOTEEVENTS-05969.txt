Admission Date:  [**2852-12-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2853-4-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2785-3-15**]     Sex:  F

Service:

ADDENDUM:  She has previously been dictated up until [**2853-3-10**].

Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7523**] state remained unchanged over the
preceding four weeks.  In an attempt to improve her mental
status, she was tried with Provigil 200 mg once per day,
bromocriptine 7.5 mg, and Ritalin 20 mg b.i.d.  However,
there was no change in her mental status.  She remained
minimally responsive to voice.  Although she was awake during
examination, she never followed commands beyond closing her
eyes.

Her main problems related to generalized spasticity,
including spasticity of her neck and right upper extremity.
In order to facilitate her physical therapy, she was started
on Baclofen.  The doses were gradually titrated with some
improvement in spasticity.

She remained fed by a gastrostomy tube.  She had one possible
episode of aspiration pneumonia without changes in her vital
signs.  Her sputum and blood cultures remained negative;
however, she was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.

Her extended hospital stay has essentially related to her
insurance status.  She is an illegal visitor from [**Country 1695**] and
is not eligible for benefits.  We have been unable to find
nursing home placement, and the family has been unsuccessful
in their extensive attempts to secure funding for nursing
home for her also.

Her nutritional status remained good, although she did have
evidence of an iron deficiency anemia.  Therefore, she was
started on iron supplementation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  (Her current medications are)
1.  Celexa 40 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Baclofen 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg once per day.
4.  Levetiracetam 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
6.  Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Lansoprazole 30 mg once per day.
8.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.

She has had no difficulties with blood pressures, and she has
had no further clinical seizures.

Her care will be taken over by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7524**].

     HEAD CT.
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  80___ year old woman with known right thalamic
     hemorrhage.  Follow-up examination.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the foramen magnum
     through the cranial vertex without the administration of IV contrast.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made with the next-prior study from approximately
     12 hours earlier.
     
     HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  In the interval since the previous exam, there
     has been placement of an intraventricular shunt from a left frontal approach.
     There has been a resultant decrease in size in the left lateral ventricle as
     well as the third ventricle.  There has been no interval change in the size of
     hemorrhage originating from the right thalamic region with intraventricular
     hemorrhage extending into the right lateral ventricle as well as the fourth
     ventricle and aqueduct.  There has been no change in the slight shift of
     normally midline structures to the left.  The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 168**] of the right
     lateral ventricle remains dilated.  No new areas of edema are identified.  The
     remainder of the study is unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No significant interval change in extent of right thalamic hemorrhage with
     intraventricular extent.
     
     2) Status post placement of intraventricular shunt with subsequent decrease in
     the size of the left lateral and third ventricles.

     INDICATION: Thalamic hemorrhage assess.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     FINDINGS:
     There is a 3 cm x 2.5 cm hemorrhage within the right thalamus with surrounding
     hypodensity indicating edema with slight shift of the normally midline
     structures to the left with extension as interventricular hemorrhage within
     the right lateral ventricle, left lateral ventricle and fourth ventricle.
     There is prominence of the ventricles bilaterally. The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 168**] of the
     right lateral ventricle is dilated. There is a small area of hypodensity
     within the right cerebellar hemisphere. There is periventricular white matter
     low attenuation consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change. No
     extraaxial collections are identified. The osseous structures and visualized
     paranasal sinuses are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. There is a large right thalamic hemorrhage with slight shift of
     the normally midline structures to the left. There is interventricular
     extension. There is dilatation of the ventricles consistent with non-
     communicating hydrocephalus.
     
     2. Probable chronic right cerebellar infarction.
     
     These findings were directly communicated to the clinicians caring for the
     patient at the time of the examination.

     is noted.  There is opacification of the left lower lobe, with air
     bronchograms and loss of the left diaphragmatic border. These are consistent
     with pneumonia.  No other focal pulmonary opacities or pleural effusions
     identified.  No pneumothorax.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: S/P right thalamic hemorrhage and a ventriculostomy drain placed.
     Currently not functioning. Evaluate for change in position.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISON: Head CT from [**12-29**].
     
     FINDINGS: Again intraventricular shunt is seen entering from the left frontal
     approach with its tip in the region of the 3rd ventricle. There is a
     persistent asymmetry to the appearance of the temporal horns of the
     ventricular system with the right being greater than the left. There has been
     overall increase in size of the lateral and third ventricles, compared with
     the prior exam.
     Again the right thalamic hemorrhage is noted, not changed in size. There is
     extension of the hemorrhage into the ventricular system predominantly
     involving the right lateral ventricles with a small amount of layering blood
     within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 168**] of the left ventricle. There is mild shift of the
     midline slightly to the left, unchanged.
     There is blood along the intraventricular catheter course, involving the left
     frontal lobe, consistent with hemorrhage along the tract. This has increased
     from the prior study.
     There is a stable area of hypodensity within the right cerebellar hemisphere
     and stable periventricular white matter low attenuation, likely reflecting
     chronic infarction.
     
     There is progressive increasing fluid within the ethmoid air cells, maxillary
     and sphenoid sinuses likely related to the patient's intubation. The mastoid
     air cells are free of fluid.  No skull fractures are seen. The orbits are
     within normal limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Stable right thalamic hemorrhage with slight shift of the normally midline
     structures to the left.
     2. Ventricular shunt unchanged in position. There is persistent mild asymmetry
     to the ventricles, the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 168**] is dilated, and there is
     generalized increase in size of the ventricles, compared with the prior study.
     This is consistent with the provided history of drain malfunction.
     3. Slight increase in the amount of hemorrhage associated with the
     ventriculostomy catheter tract in the left frontal cortex.
     4. Remainder of the exam is unchanged.
                                                                 (Over)

     progression of hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, drain location.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT exam of the head.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Head CT of approximately 11 hours earlier.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change in the previously described
     right thalamic hemorrhage with right intraventicular extension.  There is no
     evidence of new intra or extra-axial hemorrhages.  There has been a decrease
     in the amount of hemorrhage associated with the catheter tract of the left
     frontal cortex.  With regard to the ventricular catheter, the tip of the
     catheter appears to be slightly advanced on the present study with the tip now
     overlying the inferomedial portion of the right thalamus.  There has been an
     overall decrease in the size of the ventricles with persistent slight increase
     in the size of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 168**].  There is no new mass effect or
     increase in the slight leftward shift of the mid-line structures.  The
     visualized paranasal sinuses are stable in appearance, with persistent fluid
     within the ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Stable right thalamic hemorrhage with slight leftward shift
     of the mid-line structures.
     
     2)  Slight advancement of the intraventricular catheter with an associated
     decrease in the size of the ventricles, compared with the prior study.
     
     3)  Decrease in the amount of hemorrhage associated with the catheter tract
     within the left frontal cortex.
     
     4)  No new intra/extra-axial hemorrhages or mass effect.

     FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2853-1-3**].
     
     There is a right internal jugular catheter with tip in the mid superior vena
     cava.  Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  The patient is
     rotated.  When compared with the prior study, there has been interval
     opacification of much of the left lung with abrupt truncation of the left main
     stem bronchus which may be secondary to mucous plug.  There is volume loss
     involving the left lower lobe and likely portions of the lingula.  There are
     patchy areas of consolidation within both lungs.  No pleural effusion is seen
     on the right.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.Interval volume loss in association with truncation of the left main stem
     bronchus.  This is consistent with volume loss likely secondary to a mucous
     plug.
     
     2. Consolidation in right lung which may reflect asymmetric edema or
     infection.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Feeding tube is in stomach.  Right jugular CV line is in
     distal SVC. No pneumothorax. Since the previous film of [**2853-1-5**], there has been
     partial re-expansion of the left lung with persistent opacity in the left lung
     zone obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.  Linear atelectasis in the left mid
     zone.  There has been resolution of the focal area of air space opacity in the
     right upper lobe.  There is prominence of the left heart but difficult to
     evaluate in this single AP view in view of the persistent collapse
     consolidation of the left lower lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Partial re-expansion of left lung with persistent left lower lobe
     consolidation/collapse.  Resolution of right upper lobe
     consolidation.Prominent left cardiac contour.

     FINDINGS:  A single frontal view of the chest with comparison to [**2853-1-8**].  A
     feeding tube terminates within the stomach.  There is persistent opacification
     of the left retrocardiac region which is not significantly changed.  When
     compared with the prior study, there has been interval airspace disease
     involving the left upper lobe.  There are no focal abnormalities within the
     right lung.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no definite congestive heart
     failure.  The heart is large but not significantly changed.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Persistent left lower lobe consolidation versus collapse.
     
     2.  Interval alveolar opacities within the left upper lobe.  This may
     represent an asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Alternatively, aspiration or
     infectious process should be considered.

     FINDINGS:  There has been no significant change in the size or appearance of
     the previously described right thalamic hemorrhage.  There are no intra or
     extra axial fluid collections. The thalamic hemorrhage continues to cause mild
     mass effect upon adjacent structures, but this too appears stable in the
     interval.  The patient is status post removal of a ventricular drain. The
     ventricles appear stable without evidence of hydrocephalus. There is a small
     amount of air within the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 168**] of the lateral ventricle which is
     most likely related to the recent drain removal. The [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
     differentiation is grossly preserved. The visualized osseous structures are

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     CLINICAL INDICATION: 67-year-old female with a thalamic hemorrhage and
     hydrocephlus, now with decreased alertness.
     
     TECHNIQUE: CT of the brain without intravenous contrast.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination dated [**2853-1-17**].
     
     FINDINGS: The residua of the previously described right thalamic hemorrhage
     persist. It now has a target-like appearance, with a hyperdense rim and
     center. This most likely represents evolution of the hemorrhage, which
     originally was much more extensive. There is no evidence of an acute
     intracranial hemorrhage. There is persistent mass effect with impingement upon
     the right lateral ventricle and mild shift of the midline structures at the
     level of the thalamus. Overall, there has been an improvement in the degree of
     mass effect and edema, consistent with partial resorption of the hemorrhage.
     The [**Doctor Last Name **]/white matter differentiation is grossly preserved. There are areas of
     low attenuation within the white matter adjacent to the cerebral ventricles
     which could represent a mixture of residual edema and chronic microvascular
     ischemic changes. The ventricles are not enlarged.
     
     The visualized paranasal sinuses are notable for mucosal thickening involving
     the sphenoid sinuses as well as mild opacification of the mastoid air cells.
     
     A bony defect from the now-removed ventricular drain is present in the left
     frontal bone.
     
     IMPRESSION: Continued evolution of subacute right thalamic hemorrhage.
     Although this appearance would be most unsuual for an infectious process,
     imaging with intravenous contrast in the setting of a subacute hemorrhage
     would not be specific for abscess, given the breakdown of the blood-brain
     barrier that is caused by numerous pathological processes, including
     hemorrhage.

     TECHNIQUE: CT head with no IV contrast.
     
     CT HEAD WITH NO IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute intracranial
     hemorrhage. The previously reported right thalamic hemorrhage demonstrates
     interval decrease in density and slight decrease in size, consistent with
     evolving  hemorrhage. There is also slight decrease in the associated mass
     effect. Currently, there is no evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus. The
     [**Doctor Last Name **] white matter differentation appears unremarkable. Areas of decreased
     density are noted in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral
     hemispheres, consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions, unchanged
     since the prior study.
     
     An air fluid level is noted in the right sphenoid sinus air cell.
     Opacification of the mastoid air cells are also noted, with associated osseous
     sclerosis, indicative of a chronic inflammatory process.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Findings are consistent with evolving hematoma in the right thalamic
     region. Currently there is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
     
     2. Sinusitis and probable chronic mastoid air cell infection.

     sinuses are clear.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) No evidence of intra axial or extra axial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
     2) Area of low attenuation in the region of right thalamus consistent with
     resolution of right sided thalamus hematoma. Low attenuation within the
     periventricular white matter consistent with chronic microvascular infarct.
     3) Fluid level within the right sphenoid sinus.
     4) MRIwith contrastmay be performed to exclude underlying other etiologies, if
     clinically warranted.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      68 year old woman with ICH, on tube feeds, now with decreased O2 sats, frothy 
      sputum
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please assess for infiltrate

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post intracranial hemorrhage, with tube feeds, now with
     decreased oxygen saturation and frothy sputum.
     
     CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP:  Comparison [**2853-3-3**].  There is a new large
     left lower lobe opacity, which extends to the left mid lung zone.  Air
     bronchograms are demonstrated within this density.  There is obliteration of
     the diaphragmatic border.  The right lung appears clear.  No pneumothorax.
     Aortic calcifications are again demonstrated.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. New large left lower lobe opacity, worrisome for pneumonia.  Partial
     collapse of the left lower lobe is also possible.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        67 year old woman with endocarditis and right thalamic bleed, now with cough 
      and low grade temp. Portable AP suggests LLL pneumonia, but not clearly 
      visualized.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      please evaluate for retrocardiac opacity, lll pneumonia

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  History of endocarditis and intracranial hemorrhage. Now with cough
     and low grade fever.
     
     A single AP semi upright portable radiograph of the chest is compared with
     next previous exam of [**2853-4-3**].  In the interval since that study there has been
     significant improvement in the aeration of the left lower lobe though there is
     some persistent minor density in this region.  The heart size remains enlarged
     with left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded. The
     pulmonary vessels are normal with no evidence of CHF.  No new focal areas of
     consolidation are identified.  Note is made of a small rounded density
     overlying the left upper quadrant, consistent with a left renal stone
     identified on abdominal CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Significant interval improvement in previous consolidation of the left lower
     lobe. The rapid improvement suggests the etiology of this opacity may be
     aspiration vs. atelectasis.
