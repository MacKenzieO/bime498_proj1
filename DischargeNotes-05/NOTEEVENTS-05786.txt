ADDENDUM:

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since transfer from the Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the floor team on [**2825-9-29**], patient
has done well.  Issues have included:  1. Status post
variceal GI bleed:  Patient has been stable since his
transfer to the floor.  His hematocrit has remained stable
and has continued to be checked periodically.  He has had no
more bleeding.  Propranolol has been continued to lower his
portal hypertension.

2. Infectious disease:  Patient has continued on penicillin-G
for treatment of gram-positive alpha Strep isolated on blood
cultures from [**9-22**] and [**9-23**].  He will continue on these
antibiotics through [**2825-10-9**] to complete a greater than two
week course.  We continued to await identification of the
organism from the state laboratory.  The patient is not
receiving treatment for a past sputum culture and
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  He has
continued to be afebrile, asymptomatic, and having normal
white blood cell count.

2. Cirrhosis:  Patient has not been encephalopathic since his
transfer to the floor.  He has continued to have a clear
mental status.  He is continued on lactulose with a goal of
three stools per day.

3. Transaminitis status post TIPS procedure:  LFTs have been
monitored periodically in this patient since his TIPS
procedure.  Although he has had mild elevations with the
LFTs, overall they were within acceptable limits.  Most
importantly, his total bilirubin and INR have not been
elevated.  On last check on [**2825-10-4**], values included ALT
of 66, AST 93, LD 261, alkaline phosphatase 59, total
bilirubin 1.4.

4. Left eye cloudiness:  The patient noted left eye
cloudiness approximately five days after being transferred to
the floor.  However, he reported it had been noticeable since
his discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, that he
had simply failed to mention it.  It has been then improving
since that time with Artificial Tears.  I will have the
patient follow up outpatient Ophthalmology.

5. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient has been
continued on a low sodium house diet.  He has been tolerating
this well.  Electrolytes have been replaced as needed.
6. Rehabilitation:  Patient was seen by both Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy.  He has made great strides during
his stay on the floor.  He has been discharged by both
Physical and Occupational therapy.  He is successfully
ambulating around the unit without difficulty.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 526**]
Hospital for completion of his IV penicillin.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Esophageal varices with bleeding.
2. Cirrhosis.
3. Hepatitis B without hepatic carcinoma.
4. Hypertension.
5. Mental status changes now resolved.
6. Bacteremia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Combivent 1-2 puffs inhaled q.4h. prn.
2. Spironolactone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lactulose 30 mL q.8h. prn for a goal of three stools per
day.
4. Propanolol 80 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Multivitamin tablets one cap p.o. q.d.

10. Penicillin-G 4 mU IV q.4h. to complete a two week course
through [**2825-10-9**].

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient will follow up with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 7143**] in [**Location (un) 3410**].  He will
schedule this appointment at his convenience once he is
discharged from rehabilitation.  Instructions will be made to
have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7143**] facilitate the patient and seen at outpatient
ophthalmologist once the patient has obtained insurance.

     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view.  Comparison study taken a few hours
     earlier.  The [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube appears satisfactorily positioned with its
     balloon well inflated just below the esophagogastric junction.  The ETT tip is
     also well positioned approximately 3 cm above the carina.  There is again
     evidence of collapse/consolidation of the right upper lobe.  No other focal
     abnormality is seen in the lungs.  No definite pleural effusions are
     demonstrated but minimal blunting of the right CP angle may be present.  An
     NG line is also noted in the esophagus with its tip extending into the mid
     portion of the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory placement of [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube.  ETT in good position.
     Right upper lobe collapse/consolidation noted.

     [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 629**] tube has been positioned in the interval since the prior study
     which courses along the expected location of the esophagus and the tip
     overlies the body of the stomach.  A round lucency overlies the distal
     third of the esophagus, consistent with the inflated balloon.  The
     endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. The study is again notable for low
     lung volumes and there is medial right lower lobe opacification.  Note that
     there is also a nasogastric tube in place which extends out of the field of
     view inferiorly.

     CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: Variceal bleeding treated with [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube. Back for right
     upper lobe collapse.
     
     FINDINGS: A single AP supine view. Comparison study taken less than 1 hour
     earlier on [**2825-9-21**]. The collapse/consolidation of the right upper
     lobe is confirmed. This may be related to the presence of an accessory
     bronchus from the trachea to the apical segment of the right upper lobe. The
     ETT is close to the origin of this accessory bronchus. These appearances are
     essentially unchanged. The [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube remains in good position. The heart
     and pulmonary vessels are unremarkable, allowing for supine posture.
     
     IMPRESSION: Persistent right upper lobe collapse/consolidation. The
     possibility of this being related to an anomalous accessory apical segment
     bronchus originating from the trachea is suggested. It might help if the ETT
     were withdrawn 1 or 2 cm. The appearances are essentially unchanged since the
     prior study.

     HISTORY:  A 54-year-old man with history of Hep-C cirrhosis, now with massive
     upper GI bleed status post recent banding of oesophageal  varices. Massive
     upper GI bleed due to esophageal varices with [**Last Name (un) **] tube still actively
     bleeding.
     TIPS procedure was requested.
     
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 765**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], attending radiologist, present
     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under general
     anesthesia.  300 ml of Optiray 60% and 20 ml of CO2 were used.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the
     patient's family members and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     wife as the patient was intubated and sedated.
     
     The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia and
     sonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-
     gauge needle and a .18 wire was placed through the needle into the superior
     vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for a micro-puncture sheath.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire was placed into the superior vena cava and skin entry site
     was dilated using a 12-French dilator.  A 10-French long sheath was placed
     over the wire into the IVC just below the diaphragm.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was
     exchanged for a .035 [**Doctor Last Name 647**] wire, Cobra catheter was placed into the middle
     hepatiac vein.  Injection of contrast through the catheter showed a patent
     hepatic vein.  A sheath was also advanced over the catheter into the middle
                                                                 (Over)

     hepatic vein.  The catheter and wire were removed and a 8.5-French occlusion
     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-
     caval shunt placement.

     Reassess previous collapse of right upper lobe.  ck central line.
     
     A SINGLE AP SUPINE VIEW: Present study was taken 7 hours earlier on same date.
     There has now been almost complete reexpansion of the previously collapsed
     right upper lobe, however, there is now evidence of consolidation and some
     collapse of the right lower lobe, as well as the right middle lobe.  In
     addition, the left lower lobe shows consolidation.  These findings suggest
     aspiration changes.  The [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube and ET tube remain in good position. A
     new right IJ central line is noted, its tip at the upper end of the right
     brachiocephalic vein.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Further reexpansion of right upper lobe.
     
     2)  New consolidation and some collapse of the right lower lobe, right middle
     lobe and left lower lobe.  Follow-up films are recommended to assess further
     change.

     FINDINGS:  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 629**] tube appears unchanged in position, with an inflated
     balloon noted in the region of the stomach.  There also appears to have been
     some interval inflation of the balloon in the region of the esophagus.  An NG
     tube and endotracheal tube are also present, without change in position.  The
     cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is some residual
     atelectasis of the right upper lobe.  There is some evidence of redistribution
     of the pulmonary vasculature, however, this could be due to the patient's
     supine position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the right upper lobe, when compared to that
     of [**2825-9-21**].  However, there is residual atelectasis remaining in
     this region.  There is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 629**] tube inflated within the stomach. There
     also appears to be some evidence of inflation within the esophagus.

     HISTORY:  A 54-year-old man with history of Hep-C cirrhosis, now with massive
     upper GI bleed status post recent banding of oesophageal  varices. Massive
     upper GI bleed due to esophageal varices with [**Last Name (un) **] tube still actively
     bleeding.
     TIPS procedure was requested.
     
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 765**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], attending radiologist, present
     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under general
     anesthesia.  300 ml of Optiray 60% and 20 ml of CO2 were used.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the
     patient's family members and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     wife as the patient was intubated and sedated.
     
     The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia and
     sonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-
     gauge needle and a .18 wire was placed through the needle into the superior
     vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for a micro-puncture sheath.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire was placed into the superior vena cava and skin entry site
     was dilated using a 12-French dilator.  A 10-French long sheath was placed
     over the wire into the IVC just below the diaphragm.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was
     exchanged for a .035 [**Doctor Last Name 647**] wire, Cobra catheter was placed into the middle
     hepatiac vein.  Injection of contrast through the catheter showed a patent
     hepatic vein.  A sheath was also advanced over the catheter into the middle
                                                                 (Over)

     hepatic vein.  The catheter and wire were removed and a 8.5-French occlusion
     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-
     caval shunt placement.

     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-
     caval shunt placement.

     HISTORY:  A 54-year-old man with history of Hep-C cirrhosis, now with massive
     upper GI bleed status post recent banding of oesophageal  varices. Massive
     upper GI bleed due to esophageal varices with [**Last Name (un) **] tube still actively
     bleeding.
     TIPS procedure was requested.
     
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 765**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], attending radiologist, present
     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under general
     anesthesia.  300 ml of Optiray 60% and 20 ml of CO2 were used.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the
     patient's family members and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     wife as the patient was intubated and sedated.
     
     The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia and
     sonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-
     gauge needle and a .18 wire was placed through the needle into the superior
     vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for a micro-puncture sheath.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire was placed into the superior vena cava and skin entry site
     was dilated using a 12-French dilator.  A 10-French long sheath was placed
     over the wire into the IVC just below the diaphragm.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was
     exchanged for a .035 [**Doctor Last Name 647**] wire, Cobra catheter was placed into the middle
     hepatiac vein.  Injection of contrast through the catheter showed a patent
     hepatic vein.  A sheath was also advanced over the catheter into the middle
                                                                 (Over)

     hepatic vein.  The catheter and wire were removed and a 8.5-French occlusion
     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-
     caval shunt placement.

     The liver shows evidence of increased echogenecity and nodularity consistent
     with cirrhosis.  There is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal
     dilatation.
     
     There is evidence of ascites.  The spleen is enlarged.  No gallstones are
     seen.  The gallbladder walls are of normal thickness.
     
     Color and duplex doppler evaluation of the hepatic arteries, portal vein and
     splenic vein demonstrates patent forward flow within these vessels.  There is
     no evidence of cavernous transformation of the main portal vein.
     
     The pancreas is unremarkable.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis
     bilaterally.  The left kidney measures 13.8 cm in longitudinal diameter.  A
     sagital view of the right kidney was not provided.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is evidence of cirrhosis, ascites and splenomegaly.

     INDICATION:  Varicele bleed being treated by [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube in the stomach.
     Reassess chest x-ray with evidence of right upper lobe collapse.
     
     FINDINGS:  A single AP supine view.  Comparison study taken 1 hour earlier.
     The endotracheal tube appears to be advanced and its tip is now approximately
     1.5 cm above the carina.  The repositioning of this tube is associated with
     significant partial reexpansion of the right upper lobe.  Only the anterior
     segment still shows evidence of some collapse.  Elsewhere the lungs are clear.
      There might be minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a
     small effusion but the left costophrenic angle is sharp.  The heart is
     possibly slightly enlarged.  The pulmonary vessels are unremarkable.  The
     [**Last Name (un) 629**] tube remains in good position.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Substantial reexpansion of the previously collapsed/consolidated right upper
     lobe following repositioning of the endotracheal tube.  Possible minimal right
     sided effusion noted.

     The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia and
     sonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-
     gauge needle and a .18 wire was placed through the needle into the superior
     vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for a micro-puncture sheath.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire was placed into the superior vena cava and skin entry site
     was dilated using a 12-French dilator.  A 10-French long sheath was placed
     over the wire into the IVC just below the diaphragm.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was
     exchanged for a .035 [**Doctor Last Name 647**] wire, Cobra catheter was placed into the middle
     hepatiac vein.  Injection of contrast through the catheter showed a patent
     hepatic vein.  A sheath was also advanced over the catheter into the middle

     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-
     caval shunt placement.

     balloon catheter was placed into the distal middle hepatic vein and the
     balloon was inflated followed by injection of 20 ml of CO2 .Portogram done in
     both AP and Lateral views .  The portal vein and its branches are widely open
     with no filling defect or anomaly.  A 9-French sheath over an angled metallic
     cannula was placed through the 10-French sheath into the middle hepatic vein
     and a 14-gauge transjugular needle inside a 5-French catheter were placed
     through the cannula.  The needle was then advanced from the hepatic vein to
     _____ posteriorly into the right portal vein.  The needle was removed and a
     .035 guide wire was placed through the catheter into the portal vein.  A 5-
     French multi-sidehole straight catheter was placed over the wire into the
     portal vein.  The wire was removed and the portagram was performed which
     showed patent portal, superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Portal pressure
     was measured through the catheter which shows 55 mm of mercury.  A .035
     Amplatz wire was then placed through the catheter with its tip in the splenic
     vein.  This was followed by deployment of a 10 mm- 94 mm wall stent with the
     distal end in the mid-portal vein and the proximal end in the mid-hepatic
     vein.  The stent was dilated using 10 mm and 4 cm balloon along its entire
     course and a repeat portagram showed widely open portal-caval shunt. At the
     end of the procedure, the portal pressure measured 32 mm of mercury. At the
     end of the procedure, the sheath was removed and an 8.5- French quadraple
     lumen catheter was placed over the Bentsonwire into the superior vena cava.
     The catheter was secured to the skin using an 0-prolene suture and a light
     pressure dressing was applied to the skin entry site.  The patient tolerated
     the procedure well with no complications.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  None.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Portal hypertension.  Successful transjugular hepatic portal-

     and supervising throughout the procedure.
     
     MEDICATIONS AND ANESTHESIA:  The procedure was performed under general
     anesthesia.  300 ml of Optiray 60% and 20 ml of CO2 were used.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the
     patient's family members and informed consent was obtained from the patient's
     wife as the patient was intubated and sedated.
     
     The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck was
     prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia and
     sonographic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed using a 21-
     gauge needle and a .18 wire was placed through the needle into the superior
     vena cava.  The needle was exchanged for a micro-puncture sheath.  A .035
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire was placed into the superior vena cava and skin entry site
     was dilated using a 12-French dilator.  A 10-French long sheath was placed
     over the wire into the IVC just below the diaphragm.  The [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was

     HISTORY:  54 year-old male with hepatic cirrhosis, pre-liver transplant.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Utilizing the Toshiba CT scanner, 5 mm slices were obtained prior
     to the intravenous administration of contrast material throughout the abdomen
     and pelvis, following IV contrast 5 mm contiguous images were obtained through
     the liver in the aterial, portovenous, and hepatic venous phases, as well as 5
     mm contiguous images throughout the abdomen and pelvis following a 3 minute
     delay.  Multiplanar reformatted images, including maximum intensity projection
     images and 3D volumetric rendered images were created and reviewed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a 4 mm nodule in the
     left lung base.  No effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.
     
     The liver is mildly nodular in appearance, there is a 3 mm rounded low-density
     structure in the right lobe of the liver, which is too small to characterize.
     A right biliary stent is in place extending to the common bile duct.  The
     spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are grossly normal in appearance.  The
     visualized loops of large and small bowel are normal.  There is no free air,
     free fluid, or significant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are a few diverticula off
     of the colon without adjacent inflammatory changes.  The urinary bladder and
     prostate are normal in appearance.  No free air or fluid is noted in the
     abdomen.
     
     Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM:  There is conventional hepatic arterial anatomy without replaced
     or accessory arteries visualized.  The splenic, superior mesenteric, and
     portal veins are patent.  The left and right portal veins are patent.  There
     are mild splenic varices.  The hepatic veins are normal in appearance and
     drain into the inferior vena cava.
     Total liver volume is estimated to be 2229.6 cc.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy without evidence of
     replaced or accessory vessels. Nodular liver without focal mass. Total liver
     volume 2229.6 cc.

     There is a 4 mm nodule in the left lung base which may represent a granuloma
     or other benign process.  However, if no old CT studies are available for
     comparison, it is recommended that this nodule be compared on subsequent CT

     CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT ANGIOGRAM ON
     [**2826-3-26**].
     
     HISTORY:  54 year-old male with hepatic cirrhosis, pre-liver transplant.
     
     PROCEDURE:  Utilizing the Toshiba CT scanner, 5 mm slices were obtained prior
     to the intravenous administration of contrast material throughout the abdomen
     and pelvis, following IV contrast 5 mm contiguous images were obtained through
     the liver in the aterial, portovenous, and hepatic venous phases, as well as 5
     mm contiguous images throughout the abdomen and pelvis following a 3 minute
     delay.  Multiplanar reformatted images, including maximum intensity projection
     images and 3D volumetric rendered images were created and reviewed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a 4 mm nodule in the
     left lung base.  No effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.
     
     The liver is mildly nodular in appearance, there is a 3 mm rounded low-density
     structure in the right lobe of the liver, which is too small to characterize.
     A right biliary stent is in place extending to the common bile duct.  The
     spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are grossly normal in appearance.  The
     visualized loops of large and small bowel are normal.  There is no free air,
     free fluid, or significant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are a few diverticula off
     of the colon without adjacent inflammatory changes.  The urinary bladder and
     prostate are normal in appearance.  No free air or fluid is noted in the
     abdomen.
     
     Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     CT ANGIOGRAM:  There is conventional hepatic arterial anatomy without replaced
     or accessory arteries visualized.  The splenic, superior mesenteric, and
     portal veins are patent.  The left and right portal veins are patent.  There
     are mild splenic varices.  The hepatic veins are normal in appearance and
     drain into the inferior vena cava.
     Total liver volume is estimated to be 2229.6 cc.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy without evidence of
     replaced or accessory vessels. Nodular liver without focal mass. Total liver

     INDICATIONS:  Cirrhosis and TIPS. 
     
     COMPARISON: [**2825-9-25**].
     
     FINDINGS:
     [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color, and doppler sonograms were performed of the right upper
     quadrant to assess for TIPS patency.
     
     The main portal vein is patent and demonstrates hepatopetal flow with
     velocities of 15 cm per second, which is decreased from the prior study
     (previously 30 cm per second). A TIPS is again seen crossing the right portal
     vein and extending to the right hepatic vein.
     
     All the intra-TIPS velocities are significantly decreased from the prior exam.
     Velocities in the proximal aspect of the shunt were measured at 23 cm per
     second (previously 60 cm per second). Intra TIPS velocity measured in the mid
     portion of the shunt were 28 cm per second (previously 80 cm per second).
     Velocities in the distal portion of the shunt were measured at 30 cm per
     second (previously 140 cm per second). Additionally, flow within the left
     portal vein has reversed in direction since the prior study and is now flowing
     inappropriately away from the shunt.
     
     The left hepatic vein and middle hepatic vein are patent and demonstrate
     normal wave forms. The left hepatic artery is also patent and demonstrates
     normal arterial wave forms.
     
     Gallbladder is unremarkable without evidence of stones, sludge, or gallbladder
     wall edema. The common bile duct is normal in size measuring 4 mm. No ascites
     is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:   Interval decrease in main portal vein and intra-TIPS velocities
     with reversal of flow within the left portal vein which is now flowing
     inappropriately away from the TIPS. Findings indicative of TIPS malfunction.
     
     Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1620**] at the time of interpretation on
     [**2826-4-16**] at 11:00 AM.

      54 year old man with cirrhosis and malfunctioning TIPS
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt with history of cirrhosis and s/p TIPS in 10/03-now malfunctioning. Please
      do TIPS redo. Was unable to be done 2 wks ago d/t fever. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Decreased TIPS flow velocities on recent ultrasound, with new
     reversal of flow in the left portal vein, away from the transjugular
     intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Please evaluate for TIPS malfunction
     and revise as necessary.
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Resident) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**]
     d'Othee (the attending radiologist, who was present and supervised the entire
     procedure).
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
     Ultrasound was used to document a patent right internal jugular (IJ) vein.
     Hard-copy ultrasound images of the vein were taken before and during
     venopuncture. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues overlying the right IJ
     vein were anesthetized using 3 cc of 1% Lidocaine. Under continuous
     sonographic guidance, a micropuncture needle was then advanced into the IJ
     vein. An 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the right
     atrium. The needle was removed, and a skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made. A micropuncture
     sheath set was then advanced over the wire. The inner portion of the sheath
     and wire were removed, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] guide wire was then advanced into the
     inferior vena cava (IVC). The tract was then dilated to accommodate a 7 French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip angiographic sheath, which was advanced into the inferior vena cava
     after the dilator had been removed.
     
     A cobra C2 catheter was then advanced over the wire. Initial attempts at
     selecting the hepatic veins were unsuccessful using the [**Last Name (un) 129**] guidewire. The
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] was removed and exchanged for a 0.035 stiff Glidewire, which was
     advanced into the middle hepatic vein and through the TIPS Wallstent, into the
     right portal vein. The C2 catheter was removed and exchanged for a 5 French
     multi-side-holed straight catheter. The catheter was advanced into the
     superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the wire was removed. At this point, a
     portal venogram was performed, which showed opacification of both the right
     and left portal veins. There was no flow of contrast into the IVC or right
     atrium. A collateral vessel was seen arising from the left portal vein. There
                                                                 (Over)

     was no flow past the level of the distal TIPS Wallstent.
     
     Pressure measurements were taken, which showed a 22 mm Hg mean pressure
     gradient between the portal vein and right atrium. An Amplatz wire was then
     advanced through the catheter until was the tip was located distally within
     the SMV. A 10-mm x 4-cm balloon was then advanced over the wire, where the
     TIPS outflow obstruction was located. Three angioplasties were performed in
     overlap. The balloon was removed and exchanged for the 5 French multi-side-
     holed straight catheter. The Amplatz wire was then removed. The catheter was
     located in the distal SMV. A post-angioplasty venogram was then performed,
     which showed an excellent angiographic result, with free entry of contrast
     into the hepatic vein, IVC and right atrium. The small esophageal varix was no
     longer opacified. Pressure measurements were then determined, and the mean
     pressure gradient had decreased from 22 to 11 mm Hg from the portal system to
     the right atrium.
     
     The catheter was then removed. The sheath was retracted to the level of the
     SVC. The patient was transferred to a stretcher, and the head of the bed was
     elevated to 40 degrees. The sheath was removed and pressure held until

     INDICATION: Decreased TIPS flow velocities on recent ultrasound, with new
     reversal of flow in the left portal vein, away from the transjugular
     intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Please evaluate for TIPS malfunction
     and revise as necessary.
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Resident) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**]
     d'Othee (the attending radiologist, who was present and supervised the entire
     procedure).
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
     Ultrasound was used to document a patent right internal jugular (IJ) vein.
     Hard-copy ultrasound images of the vein were taken before and during
     venopuncture. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues overlying the right IJ
     vein were anesthetized using 3 cc of 1% Lidocaine. Under continuous
     sonographic guidance, a micropuncture needle was then advanced into the IJ
     vein. An 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the right
     atrium. The needle was removed, and a skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made. A micropuncture
     sheath set was then advanced over the wire. The inner portion of the sheath
     and wire were removed, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] guide wire was then advanced into the
     inferior vena cava (IVC). The tract was then dilated to accommodate a 7 French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip angiographic sheath, which was advanced into the inferior vena cava
     after the dilator had been removed.
     
     A cobra C2 catheter was then advanced over the wire. Initial attempts at
     selecting the hepatic veins were unsuccessful using the [**Last Name (un) 129**] guidewire. The
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] was removed and exchanged for a 0.035 stiff Glidewire, which was
     advanced into the middle hepatic vein and through the TIPS Wallstent, into the
     right portal vein. The C2 catheter was removed and exchanged for a 5 French
     multi-side-holed straight catheter. The catheter was advanced into the
     superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the wire was removed. At this point, a
     portal venogram was performed, which showed opacification of both the right
     and left portal veins. There was no flow of contrast into the IVC or right
     atrium. A collateral vessel was seen arising from the left portal vein. There
                                                                 (Over)

     was no flow past the level of the distal TIPS Wallstent.
     
     Pressure measurements were taken, which showed a 22 mm Hg mean pressure
     gradient between the portal vein and right atrium. An Amplatz wire was then
     advanced through the catheter until was the tip was located distally within
     the SMV. A 10-mm x 4-cm balloon was then advanced over the wire, where the
     TIPS outflow obstruction was located. Three angioplasties were performed in
     overlap. The balloon was removed and exchanged for the 5 French multi-side-
     holed straight catheter. The Amplatz wire was then removed. The catheter was
     located in the distal SMV. A post-angioplasty venogram was then performed,
     which showed an excellent angiographic result, with free entry of contrast
     into the hepatic vein, IVC and right atrium. The small esophageal varix was no
     longer opacified. Pressure measurements were then determined, and the mean
     pressure gradient had decreased from 22 to 11 mm Hg from the portal system to
     the right atrium.
     
     The catheter was then removed. The sheath was retracted to the level of the
     SVC. The patient was transferred to a stretcher, and the head of the bed was
     elevated to 40 degrees. The sheath was removed and pressure held until
     hemostasis was achieved.

     opacification of the left portal vein and a small esophageal varix. 22-mm Hg
     mean pressure gradient between the portal venous system and right atrium.
     
     2. TIPS recanalization and angioplasty using a 10-mm balloon, with good
     immediate angiographic results (no filling of left portal vein or esophageal
     varix). Improvement in mean pressure gradient from 22 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg.

     was no flow past the level of the distal TIPS Wallstent.
     
     Pressure measurements were taken, which showed a 22 mm Hg mean pressure
     gradient between the portal vein and right atrium. An Amplatz wire was then
     advanced through the catheter until was the tip was located distally within
     the SMV. A 10-mm x 4-cm balloon was then advanced over the wire, where the
     TIPS outflow obstruction was located. Three angioplasties were performed in
     overlap. The balloon was removed and exchanged for the 5 French multi-side-
     holed straight catheter. The Amplatz wire was then removed. The catheter was
     located in the distal SMV. A post-angioplasty venogram was then performed,
     which showed an excellent angiographic result, with free entry of contrast
     into the hepatic vein, IVC and right atrium. The small esophageal varix was no
     longer opacified. Pressure measurements were then determined, and the mean
     pressure gradient had decreased from 22 to 11 mm Hg from the portal system to
     the right atrium.
     
     The catheter was then removed. The sheath was retracted to the level of the
     SVC. The patient was transferred to a stretcher, and the head of the bed was
     elevated to 40 degrees. The sheath was removed and pressure held until
     hemostasis was achieved.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: None.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old man with cirrhosis and malfunctioning TIPS
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt with history of cirrhosis and s/p TIPS in 10/03-now malfunctioning. Please
      do TIPS redo. Was unable to be done 2 wks ago d/t fever. 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Decreased TIPS flow velocities on recent ultrasound, with new
     reversal of flow in the left portal vein, away from the transjugular
     intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Please evaluate for TIPS malfunction
     and revise as necessary.
     
     INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Resident) and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**]
     d'Othee (the attending radiologist, who was present and supervised the entire
     procedure).
     
     PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
     written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
     angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
     Ultrasound was used to document a patent right internal jugular (IJ) vein.
     Hard-copy ultrasound images of the vein were taken before and during
     venopuncture. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues overlying the right IJ
     vein were anesthetized using 3 cc of 1% Lidocaine. Under continuous
     sonographic guidance, a micropuncture needle was then advanced into the IJ
     vein. An 0.018 guidewire was then advanced through the needle into the right
     atrium. The needle was removed, and a skin [**Doctor Last Name **] was made. A micropuncture
     sheath set was then advanced over the wire. The inner portion of the sheath
     and wire were removed, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 129**] guide wire was then advanced into the
     inferior vena cava (IVC). The tract was then dilated to accommodate a 7 French
     [**Last Name (un) 296**]-Tip angiographic sheath, which was advanced into the inferior vena cava
     after the dilator had been removed.
     
     A cobra C2 catheter was then advanced over the wire. Initial attempts at
     selecting the hepatic veins were unsuccessful using the [**Last Name (un) 129**] guidewire. The
     [**Last Name (un) 129**] was removed and exchanged for a 0.035 stiff Glidewire, which was
     advanced into the middle hepatic vein and through the TIPS Wallstent, into the
     right portal vein. The C2 catheter was removed and exchanged for a 5 French
     multi-side-holed straight catheter. The catheter was advanced into the
     superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the wire was removed. At this point, a
     portal venogram was performed, which showed opacification of both the right
     and left portal veins. There was no flow of contrast into the IVC or right
     atrium. A collateral vessel was seen arising from the left portal vein. There
                                                                 (Over)

     PORTABLE ABDOMEN OF [**2825-9-21**].
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
     
     Air is identified throughout non-distended loops of colon.  Within the right
     side of the abdomen, there are also slightly prominent loops of air-filled
     small bowel.  On the upright view, several air-fluid levels are present in
     small and large bowel in this region.  The upright view does not include the
     diaphragms, limiting assessment for free air.  However, an upright chest
     radiograph was obtained at the time of the abdominal series, and demonstrated
     no evidence of free air.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Air-fluid levels within small and large bowel in the right side
     of the abdomen, mostly in the mid abdominal region.  In a patient with right
     lower quadrant pain, these findings could be related to an ileus from an
     adjacent inflammatory process.  Consider CT abdomen for more complete
     assessment, if warranted clinically, as communicated to the Clinical Service
     caring for the patient.

     abdominal and pleuritic chest pain.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2826-3-26**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically aquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung bases to the pubic symphysis following the administration of oral and 150
     cc of IV Optiray. Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to the
     patient's history of diabetes.  Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Again demonstrated within the lower lobe of the
     left lung is a small, noncalcified 4 mm nodule, which is unchanged since the
     prior study. No new pulmonary nodules or pleural effusions are seen at the
     lung bases.
     
     A TIPS has been placed in the interval.  The liver has a somewhat nodular
     appearance, unchanged since the prior study, without definite evidence of
     focal hepatic masses. There is a tiny 2 mm hypodensity seen within the right
     lobe of the liver, which is unchanged from the prior study, too small to fully
     characterize on this examination.  No definite intra or extrahepatic biliary
     duct dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder is mildly distended without
     calcified gallstones present.  The gallbladder wall appears within normal
     limits.  A trace amount of pericholecystic fluid cannot be fully excluded. The
     pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of
     large and small bowel are all within normal limits.  There is no free air and
     no free fluid.  There is no significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal
     lymphadenopathy.  There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The distal ureters, bladder, rectum, and prostate
     are within normal limits.  Scattered diverticula are noted within the sigmoid
     colon without adjacent inflammatory fat stranding.  There is no free fluid in
     the pelvis.  There is no significant pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
     delineating the mildly distended gallbladder.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     TIPS ULTRASOUND:  2-D, color flow, and Doppler examination of the TIPS was
     performed on an on-call, emergency basis.  The TIPS is patent and demonstrates
     wall-to-wall color flow.  The main portal vein velocity is 31 cm/sec.
     Proximal, mid, and distal velocities within the TIPS are 36, 107, and 183
     cm/sec, respectively.  The velocities and gradients between the mid and distal
     TIPS are further elevated compared to the prior study (previously mid and
     distal velocities were 80 and 120 cm/sec), suspicious for a developing
     recurrent stenosis. Both the right anterior portal vein and left portal vein
     were not optimally evaluated at this time.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Patent TIPS with flow rates from 36 to 180 cm/sec.  A more
     complete analysis of the TIPS and hepatic vessels is recommended during
     regular weekday hours after an appropriate clinical interval to assess a
     suspected developing recurrent stenosis.

     HISTORY:  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and pleuritic chest pain.
     
     COMPARISON:  Abdominal CT of [**2826-7-18**] and right upper quadrant ultrasound
     of [**2826-4-21**].  The gallbladder was not fully evaluated on the more recent
     liver/TIPS ultrasounds of [**4-24**], [**5-20**], and [**2826-7-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The gallbladder is distended.  No gallstones are identified.  There
     is a subcentimeter polyp in the gallbladder.  There may be trace edema in the
     gallbladder wall.  There is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.  There is
     no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The common duct measures 3 mm.
     Coarse liver echotexture is again noted.
     
     There is no definite sonographic [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  The patient does have
     preferential tenderness in the right upper quadrant compared to the mid
     epigastrium or the right mid abdomen during the sonographic examination.
     
     The above findings may represent early acalculous cholecystitis.  However,
     gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid may also be seen in chronic
     liver disease.  Close follow-up with serial exams is recommended.  This was
     discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 2:40PM on [**2826-7-19**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Pericholecystic fluid and equivocal gallbladder wall edema, which may be
     secondary to chronic liver disease.  However, early acalculous cholecystitis
     cannot be excluded.  If clinically indicated, a HIDA scan may be helpful.
     
     2) Subcentimeter gallbladder polyp.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Fifty-four year old male with cirrhosis, s/p TIPS placement, right  
     upper quadrant pain and abnormal gallbladder ultrasound.  Rule out acalculous
     cholecystitis. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  Serial images over the abdomen show normal uptake of tracer
     into the hepatic parenchyma.  At 5 minutes, a focal area of tracer accumulation
     is seen just inferior to the dome of the liver and then becomes less prominent
     by 90 minutes of imaging.  Tracer activity is noted in the small bowel at
     approximately 12 minutes.  The gallbladder is not visualized by 90 minutes of
     imaging.   
      
     After 2 mg of IV morphine and additional tracer are administered, accumulation
     of tracer over the liver dome is again identified by 11 minutes, but no
     gallbladder is identified. 
      
     The above findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis.  Tracer accumulation
     adjacent to the liver dome is unusual and may represent a bile leak, possibly
     related to TIPS placement. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  1) Non-visualization of the gallbladder is consistent with acute
     cholecystitis.  However, the accuracy of the study is decreased for patient's
     fasting longer than 24 hours.  2) Unusual focal area of tracer accumulation over
     the liver dome may represent an internally draining bile leak, possibly from
     recent TIPS placement.
