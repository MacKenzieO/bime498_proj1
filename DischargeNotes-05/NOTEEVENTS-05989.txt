Admission Date:  [**2588-10-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2588-11-3**]

Date of Birth:              Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old
male with a history of HIV diagnosed in [**2572**] and Hepatitis C,
now presenting with a history of nausea, vomiting and
jaundice, with right upper quadrant pain with an ultrasound
showing common bile duct dilatation, who was referred for
endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography after a failed
attempt at an outside hospital limited by ineffective
sedation.

The patient has a baseline coagulopathy and was given two
units of fresh frozen plasma pre-procedure.  After procedure,
diffuse dilation of the biliary tree with the common bile
duct at 12 mm compatible with AIDS coagulopathy and papularly
stenosis was found.  The patient had a sphincterotomy
performed with good results at 1 a.m. in the morning.  The
patient had hematemesis of 400 cc of coffee ground emesis and
bright red blood with an additional episode of 300 cc later
on.  There was red blood in the NG tube as well, and the
patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Reflux disease.
4.  Bronchitis with a history of pneumonia.
5.  Former intravenous drug abuse.
6.  Possible stroke in [**2575**].
7.  Osteomyelitis.
8.  Cellulitis.
9.  Migraine.
10. Chest pain with no documented coronary disease.

ALLERGIES:   Ventolin.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flomax.
2.  Epivir.
3.  Viramune.
4.  Klonopin.
5.  Methadone.
6.  Zofran.
7.  Valtrex.
8.  Prilosec.
9.  Percocet.
10. Zestril.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Previous intravenous drug abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, pulse is 88; blood
pressure 150/80.  In general, oriented to place and time.
Denies any nausea.  Mild scleral icterus on Head, Eyes, Ears,
Nose & Throat.  Neck showed no adenopathy; it was supple.
Chest with mild bibasilar crackles.  No wheezes.  Heart was
regular with no murmurs.  Abdomen with decreased breath
sounds, nontender in all four quadrants.  No hepatomegaly.
Extremities positive for asterixis, no edema.

LABORATORY VALUES:  Showed a white count of 7.3, hematocrit
of 31.9, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate
24, BUN and creatinine of 7 and 0.7.  Glucose is 76; ALT 28,
AST 101.  PTT 41.9, PT 1.7, alkaline phosphatase 177.
Amylase 77.  Hematocrit dropped from 38.8 at baseline down to
31.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  The ERCP team
rescoped the patient and active bleeding was noted at the
site of her previous sphincterotomy with a large overlying
adherent clot.  Epinephrine was injected as well as Bicap
cautery with successful hemostasis.  The patient was
electively intubated in the Unit for the procedure.

The patient received two units of packed red blood cells and
fresh frozen plasma.  The patient was extubated without
significant difficulty.  The patient's hematocrit dropped to
26.6 at its lowest.  The patient self-extubated on the 25th,
and the patient was weaned to nasal cannula over the course
of the night.  Blood pressure remained stable.  Hematocrit
remained in the 28 region after two units.

The patient developed a fairly significant degree of hepatic
encephalopathy from the protein load secondary to the GI
bleed and Lactulose was titrated up.  A right internal
jugular line was placed for better access.  Due likely to the
worsening hepatic encephalopathy, the patient was emergently
intubated on the 27th.

An echocardiogram was performed which showed normal left
ventricular function.  Clindamycin was started
prophylactically for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
Cefuroxime was also started.  Hematocrit remained stable in
the mid-30 range after that.

The patient was extubated again on the 29th without
difficulty.  The patient developed a sodium of 154 that was
thought secondary to dehydration.  The sodium normalized with
free water boluses per NG tube.  The patient continued to do
well with a hematocrit in the 35 range.  Mental status
returned back to baseline.

The patient was requesting his usual medications by the 29th.
The patient refused to be called out to the floor and signed
out Against Medical Advice.  The patient was alert and
oriented times three, clearly understood the risks involved
in leaving this soon after the post-sphincterotomy bleed.  A
prescription for Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q. day for seven days
was given for treatment of a presumptive aspiration pneumonia
and the patient left with his brother after signing the
forms.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Signed out Against Medical Advice.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Stable vital signs, stable
hematocrit.  Alert and oriented times three.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Post-sphincterotomy bleed with successful hemostasis on
repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin.
2.  Lactulose.

     PORTABLE SEMIUPRIGHT CHEST: Study is compared with AP supine chest radiograph
     dated [**2588-10-30**].  The cardiac size is unchanged.  There is bilateral
     prominence of the pulmonary artery consistent with the patient's history of
     pulmonary hypertension.  The ET tube is no longer present.  Right IJ line is
     in satisfactory position.  The NG tube is extending past the pylorus.  There
     is slightly increased opacities in the bilateral lungs possibly representing
     mild cardiac decompensation.  However, no pleural effusions are seen.

     2. Mild worsening of bilateral pulmonary interstitial infiltrates perhaps

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE CHEST
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION: HIV positive patient with suspected aspiration.  Assess
     for pneumonia.  Comparison is made to previous study of one day earlier.
     
     An endotracheal tube, central venous catheter and nasogastric tube remain in
     satisfactory position.  Heart size is normal.  There is marked enlargement of
     the central pulmonary arteries, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.  A
     previously noted area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region shows
     interval improvement.  The lungs otherwise appear clear, but the right
     costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study and cannot be assessed.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Improving left retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect
     improving atelectasis, or resolving aspiration or pneumonia.
     2) No new areas of consolidation are identified.
     3) Enlarged central pulmonary arteries, consistent with history of pulmonary
     artery hypertension.
