Admission Date: [**3488-10-30**]        Discharge Date: [**3488-11-20**]

Date of Birth:  [**3415-8-8**]        Sex:  F

Service:  [**Last Name (un) 591**]


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Kidney transplant.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old woman with
end-stage renal disease secondary to Type 2 diabetes mellitus
which never required insulin.  She has been on dialysis for
five years via left forearm shunt and she presents to the
[**Hospital1 75**] having been selected for
a cadaveric renal transplant.  She does make urine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus Type 2, hypercholesterolemia,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, arthritis, left forearm
atrioventricular graft, hysterectomy, appendectomy and a left
hip and left fibular fracture status post open reduction,
internal fixation

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke, she does not drink,she
lives alone.  She uses hearing aids.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Zocor 20 mg once daily
2. Prilosec 20 mg once daily
3. Folic Acid 1 mg once daily
4. PhosLo three times a day.
5. Diltiazem 100 mg once daily
6. Sulfa 5 mg once daily
7. Glucosamine 750 mg twice a day.
8. Destil 25 mg three times a week.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with stable vital
signs.  She is in no apparent distress alert and oriented
times three although she was hard of hearing.  Her heart rate
was regular rate and rhythm.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, lower
midline scar from her hysterectomy and a right lower quadrant
scar from her appendectomy.  Her extremities were warm and
well profused and her left forearm atrioventricular graft had
a palpable thrill.

Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6943**] was admitted to the Transplant Surgery Service.
Her preop labs were unremarkable including hematocrit of 37,
creatinine 6.9.  She was made NPO and consented for the
operating room, where she underwent a cadaveric renal
transplant on [**3488-10-30**].  She underwent a calcium free
immunosuppressant postop with gammaglobulin, Solu Medrol and
CellCept.  She did have delayed graft function
postoperatively and underwent hemodialysis on the third.  She
continued in euvolemic state with hemodialysis the next week
however, her urine output was slow to pick up and on postop
day eight a renal biopsy was performed to confirm or deny
rejection of the transplanted kidney.  Rejection was not seen
but acute tubular necrosis was seen in the biopsy results.
Later
that evening Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6943**] developed a rapid atrial
fibrillation with hypertension, she was transferred to the
Intensive care unit.  Soon thereafter her heart rate was
stabilized and she was transferred back to the floor however,
because she persistently had a sluggish urine output a
transplant renal ultrasound was performed on the 15th which
showed loss of the renal vein blood flow.  An Magnetic
resonance imaging of the transplanted kidney confirmed renal
vein thrombosis and Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6943**] was taken to the operating
room for a transplant nephrectomy on [**3488-11-13**].  Mrs.[**Location (un) 6944**] second postoperative course was complicated.  On
postop day two, with another bout of unstable atrial
fibrillation which was resistant to Adenosine and
cardioversion, but responded to a infusion, then she was
transitioned over to Amiodarone and her heart rate was stable
thereafter.  She was transferred back onto the floor from the
second intensive care unit stay on [**3488-11-18**] and she was doing
well enough by [**3488-11-20**] that she was transferred to a
rehabilitation facility.

Her organ system based issues on discharge are as follows:
Neurologically she is intact.  Cardiovascular:  She is on
Amiodarone 400 mg q AM, 200 mg q PM for the next two weeks
with switching to 200 mg twice a day for two weeks after
that.  She is also being anti-coagulated with Heparin drip
and transitioned to Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
She will have follow-up appointments with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 26**] within
the next month.  She is also to have continued monitoring
either with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1282**] of Hearts monitor or with Telemetry for
the next few days.  Respiratory:  She is intact.
Gastrointestinal:  She is tolerating a regular [**Doctor First Name 1412**] diet with
supplements.  FEN:  She does receive hemodialysis currently
on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.  Hematologic:  She
is intact.  ID:  She is on day 12 of 14 for an empiric C.
Diff infection.  Endocrine:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6943**] is on standing
doses of insulin as well as regular insulin sliding scale.
Prophylaxis:  She is on Prilosec for her gastroesophageal
reflux disease.  Please refer to the discharge paper work for
the final doses of these medications as well as the
instructions regarding anti-coagulation therapy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATIONS:  Cadaveric renal transplant.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     [**Doctor Last Name **] scale imaging of the renal transplant kidney demonstrates good cortical
     medullary differentiation and no evidence of hydronephrosis.  At the lower
     pole, there is a focal hypoechoic area with single echogenic focus consistent
     with likely [**Doctor First Name 9006**] in a caliceal diverticulum.  There is no perirenal fluid
     collections or perirenal hematoma seen.
     
     Color flow and pulsed-wave Doppler analysis of the transplant kidney
     demonstrates patent arteries and veins.  Analysis of the arterial waveform
     demonstrates peaking of the systolic flow with slight reversal of diastolic
     flow, indicating marked increased resistance of flow throughout the kidney.
     The venous waveforms are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Normal appearance to renal transplant kidney, no peritransplant collection
     seen.  No hydronephrosis.
     
     2.  Patent renal arteries and veins. However, peaking of the systolic arterial
     waveform with reversal of the diastolic flow indicates marked increased
     resistance to flow. Close follow-up is recommnded.

        73 year old woman with cadaveric renal transplant on [**10-30**] with delayed graft  
      function; native disease diabetes
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      delayed graft function

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Delayed graft function.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Comparison is made with the prior study dated [**3488-10-30**].  The
     transplant kidney measures 11.4 cm in length, without hydronephrosis or
     perinephric fluid.  There is reversal of diastolic flow within the intrarenal
     arterial branches, as on the prior study.  Venous flow is identified within
     the renal veins.
     
     A tiny punctate echogenic focus is noted within the lower pole, possibly
     representing a focus of crystals.
     
     Ultrasound guidance was provided for the nephrology service, for the purpose
     of transplant biopsy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     No change in the reversal of diastolic flow within the arterial branches when
     compared with the prior study dated [**3488-10-30**].  No hydronephrosis or
     perinephric fluid.
     
     Discussed with nephrology service.

     INDICATION:  Renal transplant.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Comparison is made with several renal transplant ultrasound examinations since
     [**3488-11-7**].
     
     As on the study dated [**3488-11-7**], there remains reversal of diastolic
     flow within the intrarenal arterial branches.  However, on the current
     examination, no venous waveform can be demonstrated despite extensive
     scanning, which is a new finding since [**3488-11-7**], when venous
     waveforms were identified. No renal vein could be demonstrated. The findings
     suggest renal vein thrombosis.
     
     The previously noted perinephric fluid collection has almost completely
     resolved.  Minimal ectasia of the renal pelvis is noted, without evidence of
     gross hydronephrosis.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Persistent reversal of diastolic flow within the intrarenal arterial branches;
     however, no renal vein waveforms or renal vein is identified.  The findings
     are suggestive of renal vein thrombosis.

     INDICATION: Status-post renal transplant on [**3488-10-30**], no venous flow seen on
     recent ultrasound. Assess for transplant renal vein thrombosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images, in addition to pre and post
     contrast 3D images of the pelvis were obtained. Special attention was given to
     the transplant kidney within the right lower quadrant.
     
     COMPARISON: Renal transplant ultrasound of [**3488-11-12**].
     
     MR KIDNEY WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST/MR ANGIOGRAM: The T1/T2 weighted images
     show an enlarged transplant kidney within the right lower quadrant, measuring
     up to 17 cm in length. There is diffuse abnormal low T1 signal throughout the
     renal parenchyma, with no visualization of the normal cortico-medullary
     differentiation. Within the medial perinephric space, there is a thick rind of
     predominantly fluid signal intensity, with a few focal areas of increased T1
     signal, suggestive of hemorrhagic foci. The T2 weighted images also show fluid
     signal intensity within the medial perinephric space. There is diffuse
     increased T2 signal within the renal parenchyma, suggestive of edema, in
     addition to focal linear areas of low T2 signal, suggestive of hemorrhage. The
     contrast enhanced images demonstrate a normal appearance of the common iliac
     and internal/external iliac arteries. The transplant renal artery, however,
     shows an abrupt caliber change after its origin from the external iliac
     artery, and appears severely attenuated as it enters the renal hilum. There is
     minimal enhancement of the renal parenchyma, with less than 10% of the
     parenchyma, predominately within the upper pole, showing any considerable
     enhancement. No venous outflow is seen at the renal hilum. Starting a few cm
     from the renal hilum, there is evidence of thrombus within the renal
     transplant vein which extends distally to include the external iliac vein and
     imaged portion of the common femoral vein (This is well visualized on both the
     axial and the coronal delayed contrast images).
     
     The urinary bladder is collapsed, with a Foley catheter visualized within the
     lumen. Both the urinary bladder and adjacent rectum are displaced to the left
     by the lower pole of the transplant kidney. The imaged loops of large/small
     bowel are otherwise unremarkable. There is minimal free fluid within the
     pelvis. Noted are a few prominent right inguinal lymph nodes. The visualized
     osseous structures demonstrate normal signal intensity. Noted is a partially
     imaged lumbar scoliosis.
     
     The reformatted MR angiographic images were helpful in confirming the above
                                                                 (Over)

     imaged portion of the common femoral vein (This is well visualized on both the
     axial and the coronal delayed contrast images).
     
     The urinary bladder is collapsed, with a Foley catheter visualized within the
     lumen. Both the urinary bladder and adjacent rectum are displaced to the left
     by the lower pole of the transplant kidney. The imaged loops of large/small
     bowel are otherwise unremarkable. There is minimal free fluid within the
     pelvis. Noted are a few prominent right inguinal lymph nodes. The visualized
     osseous structures demonstrate normal signal intensity. Noted is a partially
     imaged lumbar scoliosis.
     
     The reformatted MR angiographic images were helpful in confirming the above
                                                                 (Over)

     findings. These images were also essential in delineating the above described
     anatomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Findings consistent with thrombosis of the transplant renal vein, which is
     seen extending to include the external iliac vein and imaged portion of the
     common femoral vein.
     
     2.  Severely attenuated arterial supply to the renal transplant, as detailed
     above, with associated enhancement of less than 10% of the renal parenchyma.
     The transplant kidney is markedly abnormal in appearance, with considerable
     edema and blood products.
     
     3.  Perinephric fluid collection, which includes hemorrhagic products.
     
     The above findings were discussed in detail with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1277**] at the time of
     initial interpretation at 11:00 pm on [**3488-11-12**]. The findings were also

     history of external iliac vein thrombosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Unilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound with doppler.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is echogenic material within the right common femoral vein
     associated with a lack of compressibility and color flow, consistent with deep
     venous thrombosis.  This clot extends into the proximal superficial femoral
     vein. The left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins
     demonstrate normal compressibility, color flow, and doppler waveforms.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Deep thrombus within the right common femoral vein, extending
     into the proximal superficial femoral vein as above.
     
     These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1277**].

      71 year old woman with ESRD and high K's.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. needs a fistulagram per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 13221**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13222**]. She has consistently been
      having high K+s at HD. Need to assess for any inflow or outflow stenoses.
      Please angioplasty if amenable.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Increased potassium at hemodialysis.  The patient has end-stage
     renal disease with a left arm native brachiocephalic fistula.  The patient
     also mentioned left hand numbness.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 355**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**]
     [**Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**]  [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee, the staff
     radiologist, was present and supervising the procedure throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed
     supine on the angiography table.  The left upper extremity was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion.  Physical exam demonstrated palpable
     thrill throughout the arteriovenous (AV) fistula.  Using 3 cc of 1% lidocaine,
     the skin in the area of the fistula was anesthetized.  The fistula was
     accessed using a 21-gauge needle, and a 0.018-guidewire was advanced through
     the access needle into the venous outflow portion.  An 11-blade scalpel was
     used to make a small incision in the skin entry site.  The accessed needle was
     exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator.  The
     guidewire and inner dilator were removed.  The catheter was flushed and a
     small amount of nonionic contrast was injected, confirming placement.
     Sequential venography was performed from the fistula entrance site to the
     right atrium.  After this, a blood pressure cuff was inflated briefly,
     allowing for obstruction of the venous outflow, and repeat venogram was
     performed to visualize the arterial inflow.  Following this, the catheter was
     removed and manual pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.  A dry
     sterile dressing was applied.
     
     FINDINGS:  Sequential images of the left upper extremity AV fistula to the
     right atrium demonstrate no evidence of obstruction or stenosis in the venous
     outflow portion of the fistula.  There is no central occlusion evident as
     contrast flowed freely into the right atrium.  There are many venous
     collaterals that are opacified in the left arm and around the shoulder (in
     addition to the left cephalic and brachial veins) despite the absence of
     stenosis detected.  This finding may suggest increased flow through the AV
     fistula.  With the blood pressure cuff inflated, the fistulogram was repeated,
     and there is no evidence of stenosis or narrowing at the arterial anastomosis.
                                                                 (Over)

     COMPLICATIONS:  There were no significant complications.  The patient noted
     mild petechiae of the left hand after the procedure, which was likely related
     to the inflation of the blood pressure cuff.  The patient denies sensory

     CONTRAST AND MEDICATIONS:  75 cc of Optiray 320 IV.  In addition, 1 mg of

     and the patient's vital signs are continuously monitored by the nurse
     administering conscious sedation throughout the procedure.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of stenosis or occlusion involving the
     inflow, fistula, and outflow of the left brachiocephalic arteriovenous
     fistula.  There are many venous collaterals in the left arm and around the
     shoulder in the absence of a detectable stenosis.  This could suggest
     increased flow through the arteriovenous anastomosis.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      71 year old woman with ESRD and high K's.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pt. needs a fistulagram per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 13221**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13222**]. She has consistently been
      having high K+s at HD. Need to assess for any inflow or outflow stenoses.
      Please angioplasty if amenable.
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Increased potassium at hemodialysis.  The patient has end-stage
     renal disease with a left arm native brachiocephalic fistula.  The patient
     also mentioned left hand numbness.
     
     PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6869**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 355**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 317**]
     [**Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**]  [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee, the staff
     radiologist, was present and supervising the procedure throughout.
     
     PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
     the patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed
     supine on the angiography table.  The left upper extremity was prepped and
     draped in standard sterile fashion.  Physical exam demonstrated palpable
     thrill throughout the arteriovenous (AV) fistula.  Using 3 cc of 1% lidocaine,
     the skin in the area of the fistula was anesthetized.  The fistula was
     accessed using a 21-gauge needle, and a 0.018-guidewire was advanced through
     the access needle into the venous outflow portion.  An 11-blade scalpel was
     used to make a small incision in the skin entry site.  The accessed needle was
     exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath with inner dilator.  The
     guidewire and inner dilator were removed.  The catheter was flushed and a
     small amount of nonionic contrast was injected, confirming placement.
     Sequential venography was performed from the fistula entrance site to the
     right atrium.  After this, a blood pressure cuff was inflated briefly,
     allowing for obstruction of the venous outflow, and repeat venogram was
     performed to visualize the arterial inflow.  Following this, the catheter was
     removed and manual pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.  A dry
     sterile dressing was applied.
     
     FINDINGS:  Sequential images of the left upper extremity AV fistula to the
     right atrium demonstrate no evidence of obstruction or stenosis in the venous
     outflow portion of the fistula.  There is no central occlusion evident as
     contrast flowed freely into the right atrium.  There are many venous
     collaterals that are opacified in the left arm and around the shoulder (in
     addition to the left cephalic and brachial veins) despite the absence of
     stenosis detected.  This finding may suggest increased flow through the AV
     fistula.  With the blood pressure cuff inflated, the fistulogram was repeated,
     and there is no evidence of stenosis or narrowing at the arterial anastomosis.
                                                                 (Over)
