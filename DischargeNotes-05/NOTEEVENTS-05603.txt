Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 893**] 
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy. 

 
History of Present Illness:
80M with a h/o COPD and HTN, prostate ca, s/p XRT 10yrs ago, 
presents to the ED after 2 days of BRPBPR. Reportedly woke up on 
[**2722-8-10**] with sheets soaked with BRB. Got up, showered, denied 
N/V/Dizzy/Lightheadedness, denied CP, SOB, went back to bed. 
Woke up with less amount of BRBPR, worried, called PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pt, 
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6798**]: last Nov (2006) clean c-scope, so nothing to worry 
about. Pt went golfing, completed 2 holes, then noted pants 
soaked in blood. Went to the ED. Hct 37 reportedly on admission. 
In ED, reportedly, [**12-26**] tablespoons every 10-20mins, incontinent 
of stool. Still blood with no stool. No hematemesis or 
hematochezia. No chest pain, no SOB. no syncope or pre-syncope. 
Hct was as low as 29, and pt reportedly given 4units of PRBCs. 
Enzymes were checked, and he had a + MB fraction, but no EKG 
changes, Trop 0.03 thought to be an NSTEMI due to demand--pt was 
asymptomatic.  He was continued on his betablocker, aspirin was 
held due to ongoing bleeding. Transferred to OSH ICU, underwent 
a c-scope: showed bleed in sigmoid colon and left colon with no 
definite source that could be identified. Hct 30.2 on [**8-12**] at 
OSH. Hct 37 on [**8-10**]. At least 1 episode of hypoT (BP 89/60) at 
OSH, given fluids and 2u PRBCs-->hypoT quickly resolved to Bp 
120/80. Notes mention possible need for [**Female First Name (un) 613**] angiography of the 
[**Female First Name (un) 613**] to localize the source of the bleeding; therefore pt was 
transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for further workup/management. 
.  
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 83**], pt denies CP, SOB, dizziness, LH. He was 
tachycardic to 120s, other vital signs were stable.  No frank 
rectal bleeding, but bright red blood in the rectal vault.

Imaging:  
CXR at OSH showed L basilar density, unknown if new or old.
R Foot XRAY: No acute fracture or dislocation is seen.  There is 
an 
apparent lucency noted in the first distal phalanx.  This 
lucency extends to 
the articular surface of the interphalangeal joint and has well 
circumscribed 
but nonsclerotic margins.  This is best evaluated on the frontal 
and oblique 
radiographs and is not well seen on the lateral radiograph.  No 
additional 
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.  There is enthesopathy at 
the insertion 
of the Achilles tendon and a small plantar calcaneal spur.  
There is also 
trace vascular calcification.  The soft tissues are 
unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 
1.  Apparent well circumscribed lucency in the first distal 
phalanx.  Further 
evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is advised. 2.  No acute 
fracture or dislocation.

********************
80M with 2d of BRBPR likely due to diverticular bleed, s/p 
c-scope unable to localize source of bleeding, transferred to 
[**Hospital1 83**] for further workup and managment of the bleeding.  The 
bleeding had slowed dramatically by transfer.  Colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 **] 
revealed extensive diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon 
without active bleeding.  The patient's Hct stabilized at ~25 
for 24 hours, and on [**8-15**] the patient left against medical 
advice.  He and his wife stated that they understood that the 
medical team wanted to continue to monitor his Hct, to obtain a 
PT consult as the patient had been bedbound for 5 days.  The 
patient and his wife also stated their understanding that the 
patient was at risk to rebleed acutely, which could have 
devastating results.  
.
#GI: BRBPR- Unlikely upper GI source per colonoscopy, original 
bleeding form the sigmoid, left colon per OSH.  At admission the 
pt had bright red blood in the rectal vault. He was admitted to 
the MICU for close observation initially.  He remained remained 
hemodynamically stable; Hct remained ~25 x 24 hours; therefore 
he was transferred to the floor on [**8-14**].  A repeat colonoscopy 
on [**8-14**] revealed sigmoid diverticular disease but no active 
bleeding.  1 unit PRBC's transfused [**8-15**] to maintain Hct >25.  
Per GI, the patient should see surgery in outpatient follow up 
for consideration of a partial colectomy given his extensive 
sigmoid diverticular disease and high risk of re bleeding.  

#CV:
Ischemia: CKMB elevation at outside hospital; diagnosed with 
NSTEMI.  This is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of 
acute blood loss/anemia.  There was no troponin elevation, no 
EKG changes, and the patient was asymptomatic throughout. The 
patient was started on a statin and continued on a betablocker.  
Aspirin was held given GI bleed. A repeat EKG at [**Hospital1 **] was 
unchanged from OSH.  We continued the Betablocker and statin.  
The patient will follow up with his PCP for discussion of 
initiation of ASA therapy.  Pump: HTN, TTE ot OSH revealed: EF 
of 70%, hyperdynamic, with no wall motion abnormalities. 
Betablocker was continued; ACE-I was restarted on [**8-15**] (after 
stabilization of blood pressure). Rhythm: The patient had 
intermittant sinus tachycardia to the 120s, thought to be due to 
hypovolemia and + increased catechols.  This resolved overnight 
[**8-14**] with IVF hydration.  Risk factors: HTN, hyperlipidemia: On 
Beta-blocker, ACE-I, Statin.  
.
#Pulmonary: Pt has a history of COPD, on home O2. He was 
chronically wheezy on exam and was found to have a ?Left lower 
lobe infiltrate on CXR at OSH.  He was maintained on 
albuterol/atrovent nebs, his advair was continued.  He 
maintained O2 sats of 92-96% on 2LNC.  
.
#Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.4 on admission (baseline 
unknown). This was likely due to hypovolemia from his GIB, and 
resolved with IVF hydration (0.8 on [**8-15**]).
.
#heme: anemia: [**1-26**] GIB, but also has a h/o iron deficiency 
anemia, on iron supplementation at home.  The patient reportedly 
required 4 units PRBC at the OSH and did require one unit PRBC 
transfusion at [**Hospital1 **] to maintain Hct >25.  Iron supplements were 
continued.  
.
#R Foot pain: The patient reported acute onset foot pain [**8-14**] 
over R 5th MTP joint.  He denied h/o trauma; has no preceding 
h/o gout. He was found to be tender on exam w/ overlying edema, 
no erythema. Foot XRAY revealed no acute process, but did reveal 
a well circumscribed lucency in the first distal phalanx.  We 
recommend an outpatient MRI as follow up.  The patient's foot 
pain markedly improved spontaneously by [**8-15**]. 

#Prophylaxis: The patient was put on pneumoboots as PE 
prophylaxis.
