Admission Date:  [**2968-3-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2968-3-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2968-3-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEONATOLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known patient lastname 1907**] [**Known patient lastname 255**], twin number
one, was born at 23 5/7 weeks gestation by spontaneous
vaginal delivery to a 35-year-old gravida II, para I now III
woman.  The mother's prenatal screens were blood type A
positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis surface antigen negative.  This pregnancy was
conceived with in [**Last Name (un) 22**] fertilization and was reduced from
triplets to twins in [**2967-12-17**].  The pregnancy remained
uncomplicated until the day of delivery when the mother
presented in progressive labor and delivered both twins
spontaneously.  This infant's Apgar scores were three at one
minute and six at five minutes.  She required intubation in
the Delivery Room.

Her birth weight was 616 grams.  Her head circumference was
21 cm and birth length was 30.5 cm.

Her admission physical examination revealed and extremely
preterm infant.  The anterior fontanelle was open and flat.
Palate intact.  Good air exchange with manual breaths.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur.  Femoral pulse
was present.  Abdomen:  Soft.  Female genitalia appropriate
for gestational age.  A small abrasion on the left leg in the
dorsum of the right foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2968-3-11**], after discussion with the
health care team regarding the extension of the
intraventricular hemorrhage, the parents decided to redirect
care to comfort measures only.  The infant was provided with
Fentanyl for pain and discomfort and after being held by
family members, she died in her mother's arms at 4:02 p.m.

Her NICU course by systems:

1.  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  The infant was intubated in the
Delivery Room.  She did receive three doses of Surfactant and
remained on high-frequency ventilation.  On day of life
number two, she developed bloody secretions from her
endotracheal tube consistent with a pulmonary hemorrhage.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  On day of life number one, she was
treated with a course of Indomethacin for presumed patent
ductus arteriosus.  A follow-up echocardiogram on [**2968-3-7**]
showed no patent ductus present, a small muscular VSD and a
patent foramen ovale.  She did require intermittent dopamine
to a maximum of 5 micrograms per kilogram per minute.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  At the time of her
death, her weight was 555 grams.  She was maintained on
parental nutrition.  She had an umbilical arterial line and
umbilical venous catheter present.  She had some intermittent
hypernatremia and hyponatremia.  Her last set of electrolytes
on [**2968-3-11**] were sodium 126, potassium 3.3, chloride 93,
bicarbonate 26.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL STATUS:  She was treated with
phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day
of life number one until the time of her death.  Her peak
bilirubin occurred on day of life number one and it was a
total of 4.2, direct 0.3.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  She received two blood transfusions of
packed red blood cells during her NICU stay.  Her last
hematocrit of [**2968-3-10**] was 29 prior to a transfusion.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE: She was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factor.
She received seven days of antibiotics.  Her blood cultures
did remain negative.

7.  NEUROLOGIC STATUS:  Her head ultrasound on day of life
number three showed a large right intraventricular
hemorrhage with dilated right ventricle.  Follow-up head
ultrasound on [**2968-3-8**] showed no change from the previous
head ultrasound.  On [**2968-3-9**], her ultrasound showed
increasing size of both ventricles and a cerebellar
hemorrhage.  On [**2968-3-11**], her head ultrasound showed
extension of intracranial bleeding involving the right
periventricular parenchyma and bleeding evident in the left
ventricle.  The hemorrhage in the cerebellum also increased
extending from the left to include both sides now.  There was
no interval change in hydrocephalus.

The family was followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1084**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 318**], medical social
worker, beeper number [**Pager number 1386**].  The family and the extended
family were present and active in the infant's care
throughout the NICU stay.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Extreme prematurity.
2.  Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Status post presumed sepsis.
4.  Status post pulmonary hemorrhage.
5.  Status post presumed patent ductus arteriosus.
6.  Bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
7.  Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.

     respiratory distress.
     
     When compared to the films obtained earlier, the lungs do demonstrate improved
     aeration, thought there is a persistent background of diffuse hazy opacity
     consistent with hyaline membrane disease.  The umbilical venous catheter has
     been exchanged, however the catheter tip is still abnormally positioned over
     the right lobe of the liver, likely within a right hepatic vein, or middle
     hepatic vein.  The umbilical arterial catheter is in satisfactory position.

     INDICATION:  Infant born at 23 5/7th weeks gestation.  Now 3 days old.  Rule
     out intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large right intraventricular hemorrhage with an increase
     in the ventricular system size. There is a question as to whether there is
     also an early (presently isoechoic) left intraventricular hemorrhage. There is
     no evidence of extension of the right intraventricular hemorrhage to the
     parenchyma. The periventricular white matter may be slightly increased in
     echogenicitiy. The sulci and gyri of the cerebrum and cerebellum have an
     appearance consistent with the patient's premature. The resistive indices are
     without compression 0.78 and with compression 0.89. A small extraaxial fluid
     collection is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Large right intraventricular hemorrhage with ventriculomegaly with question
     of an early (presently isoechoic) left-sided hemorrhage. A close interval
     follow-up head ultrasound was recommended to the ICU team at morning rounds.
     Resistive indices are above.
     2) Question of slightly echogenic periventricular white matter.
     3) Small extra axial fluid collection.

Nutrition:  TF 160 cc/kg/day.  NPO.  PN started on DOL 1; lipids added on DOL 2.  UAC infusing 1/2 NS @ 1 cc/hr.  D10 and PN w/ D10 via DUVC for remaining fluids.  Will change to 100cc/kg/day PN tonight, w/ same UAC fluid; remaining fluid as D10 .  Projected intake for next 24 hrs from PN ~55 kcal/kg/day, ~2 g pro/kg/day, and ~1.6 g fat/kg/day.  Glucose infusion rate  from PN ~6.5 mg/kg/min.
GI:  Abdomen soft, no bowel sounds, no BM.

A/Goals:
Tolerating PN with low dstix to ~45 yesterday requiring increase in TF to ~180 cc/kg/day; now will decrease as above w/ improved dstix and lytes.  Remains NPO s/p indocin. Labs noted and PN adjusted accordingly.  Initial goal for PN is ~90 to 110 kcal/kg/day, ~3 to 3.5 g pro/kg/day, and ~3 g fat/kg/day.  Will advance PN as per protocol and tolerance.  When able to start EN, initial goal is ~150 cc/kg/day PE/BM 24, providing ~120 kcal/kg/day and; ~3.2 to 3.6 g pro/kg/day.  Expect PN to taper as EN feeds advance.  Appropriate to add Fe and Vit E supps when feeds reach initial goal.  Further increases in feeds as per growth and tolerance.   Growth goals after initial diuresis are ~15 to 20 g/kg/day for wt gain,  ~0.5 to 1 cm/wk for HC gain, and ~ 1 cm/wk for LN gain.  Will follow w/ team and participate in nutrition plans.

     HISTORY: Very early premature infant, born at 23 weeks, 5 days gestation.
     History of intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     CRANIAL ULTRASOUND: The study is compared with the cranial ultrasound from 1
     day earlier. Again seen is the right intraventricular hemorrhage. On today's
     study, there is more convincingly extension of the hemorrhage into the
     parenchyma adjacent to the right lateral ventricle. The question of left
     intraventricular hemorrhage is now more convincingly demonstrated today. At
     this point, the ventricles are non-dilated.
     
     There are no other new areas of hemorrhage seen. The fourth ventricle is not
     dilated. The cerebellum is not well seen.
     
     The extra-axial fluid spaces are normal.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Continued evolution of right intraventricular hemorrhage, now
     with more convincing extension into the adjacent brain parenchyma.
     
     2) Left sided intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     3) At this point, no ventricular dilatation.
     
     4) Note that this study was initially reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12627**] and discussed
     with the clinical service shortly after performance of the study.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      Infant born at 23 5/7 weeks gestation, now 6 days old
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      follow up previous studies showing IVH
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Former 23 week and 5 day premature infant who is now 6 days old.
     Previous head ultrasounds have shown a large right germinal matrix and
     intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     Comparison is made with the previous examinations from [**3-7**] and [**3-8**]. Again
     standard coronal and sagittal images of the brain were obtained via the
     anterior fontanelle with additional mastoid views performed. Again identified
     is the large right germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage. There has
     been a dramatic interval increase in size of both lateral ventricles and the
     third ventricle. The lateral ventricular dilatation is symmetric with the
     exception of compression of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 274**] by the large germinal
     matrix hemorrhage. There may be involvement of the right periventricular
     parenchyma at this time as well. No definite left sided germinal matrix
     hemorrhage is identified though there is intraventricular blood present within
     the left lateral ventricle. The fourth ventricle is poorly visualized even on
     the mastoid views and is echogenic and likely contains intraventricular blood
     as well. The left cerebral hemisphere is abnormally echogenic with loss of the
     normal foleal pattern. This is a new finding when compared to the previous
     films.
     
     Pulse Doppler interrogation of the anterior cerebral artery reveals resistive
     indices of approximately 0.76 and 0.75. With depression of the anterior
     fontanelle, there is loss of forward flow in end diastole for resistive index
     ranging between .95 and 1.0.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Large right sided germinal matrix hemorrhage and associated
     bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage likely extending into the fourth
     ventricle. There has been interval development of moderate to severe bilateral
     ventriculomegaly.
     
     2) Interval development of left cerebellar hemisphere abnormality likely
     representing intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
     
     3) Resistive indices now showing loss of antegrade flow in end diastole
     suggests loss of intracranial compliance related to the acute development of
     hydrocephalus.
     
     4) The findings and images were discussed at length with the neonatology team
     including the staff attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12630**] [**Name (STitle) 606**].
                                                                 (Over)

      evaluate lung fields on HFOV, evaluate bowel gas pattern
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Infant with prematurity, on high frequency ventilation.
     
     Single view of the chest from 4:35PM, [**2968-3-10**] is compared with the study
     obtained the previous morning.
     
     ET tube has been advanced slightly.  The tip now reaches the take off of the
     right main stem bronchus and should be withdrawn.  Umbilical artery catheter
     reaches the level of T7-8.  Umbilical venous catheter tip projects just below
     the level.
     
     The lungs remain stable with moderately severe changes of hyaline membrane
     disease.  Heart size remains stable.
     
     The gastric bubble is now more prominent and the stomach is distended with
     air.  There is no air seen beyond the gastric antrum and concern for gastric
     outlet obstruction of some etiology is raised.  Whether this is functional or
     anatomic is uncertain and an Upper GI series may be necessary if no air passes
     distally.
     
     These findings were all discussed with ICU team.

     INDICATION:  Very early premature infant, born at 23 weeks, 5 days gestation,
     with intraventricular hemorrhage.  This study is a follow up exam performed
     post-lumbar puncture.
     
     CRANIAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison is made with the study obtained one hour
     earlier, pre-lumbar puncture, as well as the previously day's study and
     studies obtained earlier in the week.
     
     FINDINGS:  Examination was performed through the anterior and mastoid
     fontanelles.  There was very little change in the appearance of the ventricles
     following lumbar puncture. Again seen is the right germinal matrix hemorrhage
     with intraventricular and intraparenchymal extension.  Both ventricles remain
     dilated and the left lateral ventricle is again seen to contain
     intraventricular blood.
     
     On this examination, we obtained views through the mastoid fontanelle which
     more clearly showed both left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage and new right
     cerebellar hemorrhage.  Blood is also again seen within the 4th ventricle.
     
     Duplex Doppler and color flow interrogation of the anterior cerebral artery
     revealed resistive indices of approximately 0.65 to 0.75, with no significant
     change upon application of compression.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No significant change in size or appearance of the ventricles following
     lumbar puncture.
     
     2.  No significant increase in resistive index, upon compression.
     
     3.  Stable right grade 4 germinal matrix hemorrhage/intraventricular
     hemorrhage.
     
     4.  Stable left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage.  New right cerebellar
     hemorrhage.
     
     5.  These findings and the images were discussed with the neonatology team and
     staff attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 606**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Extreme premature infant now 6 days old with history of
     intraventricular hemorrhage and enlarged ventricles.  There was also increased
     resistive indices.  This study is performed in follow up prior to lumbar
     puncture to relieve intracranial pressure.
     
     FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with the most recent prior ultrasound obtained 1
     day earlier, as well as the two prior ultrasound examinations.
     
     Again seen is a large right germinal matrix hemorrhage/intraventricular
     hemorrhage.  The ventricles remain quite dilated, but not significantly
     changed since yesterday's study.  On today's examination, there is more
     convincingly parenchymal extension of the right-sided hemorrhage into the
     adjacent parenchyma.  This is best demonstrated on coronal oblique images
     obtained later in the examination.
     
     There is also abnormal increased echogenicity of the choroid on the left,
     concerning for accompanying left choroid plexus hemorrhage.
     
     Evaluation of resistive indices reveal resistive indices ranging between .74
     and .76, with no significant change with graded compression.  Extra-axial
     fluid spaces remain normal.
     
     There is intraventricular hemorrhage extending into the 4th ventricle,
     however, the cerebellum was not well evaluated on this pre-lumbar puncture
     study.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Evolving right germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage, now with
     parenchymal extension.  This is now grade 4 hemorrhage.
     
     2.  Stable ventriculomegaly.  Improvement in resistive indices.
     
     3.  ? left choroid plexus hemorrhage.
     
     4.   Poor evaluation of the cerebellum.  These findings were reviewed with the
     clinical team.
     
     
                                                                 (Over)

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Very early premature infant, born at 23 weeks, 5 days gestation,
     with intraventricular hemorrhage.  This study is a follow up exam performed
     post-lumbar puncture.
     
     CRANIAL ULTRASOUND:  Comparison is made with the study obtained one hour
     earlier, pre-lumbar puncture, as well as the previously day's study and
     studies obtained earlier in the week.
     
     FINDINGS:  Examination was performed through the anterior and mastoid
     fontanelles.  There was very little change in the appearance of the ventricles
     following lumbar puncture. Again seen is the right germinal matrix hemorrhage
     with intraventricular and intraparenchymal extension.  Both ventricles remain
     dilated and the left lateral ventricle is again seen to contain
     intraventricular blood.
     
     On this examination, we obtained views through the mastoid fontanelle which
     more clearly showed both left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage and new right
     cerebellar hemorrhage.  Blood is also again seen within the 4th ventricle.
     
     Duplex Doppler and color flow interrogation of the anterior cerebral artery
     revealed resistive indices of approximately 0.65 to 0.75, with no significant
     change upon application of compression.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  No significant change in size or appearance of the ventricles following
     lumbar puncture.
     
     2.  No significant increase in resistive index, upon compression.
     
     3.  Stable right grade 4 germinal matrix hemorrhage/intraventricular
     hemorrhage.
     
     4.  Stable left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage.  New right cerebellar
     hemorrhage.
     
     5.  These findings and the images were discussed with the neonatology team and
     staff attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 606**].

Neonatology Attending Note

HUS this am continues to demonstrate extension of intracranial bleeding. There is extension of the bleeding on the right side to now involving the right periventricular parenchyma. There is bleeding evident in the left ventricles.  The hemorrhages in the cerebellum have also increased extending from the left side to now including the cerebellum bilaterally.  There was no interval change in the degree of hydrocephalus, which is already considered significant. 

Extensive family meetings held yesterday with the NICU team and the Neurology service. Parents are aware of the significant concern we have for [**Known patient lastname **] given her extreme prematurity and extent of intracranial bleeding for the both the short term and perhaps more importantly, the long term.

After the parents heard the unfortunate news of the extension of the intracerebral hemorrhages, the family decided to withdraw medical support.  The family held [**Known patient lastname **] and Fentanyl was given to alleviate any pain and discomfort.  

Time of death 4:02pm.
Parents declined an autopsy.
