     Reason: aortic valve replacement
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old man with aortic stenosis
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      aortic valve replacement
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Pre-operative, aortic valve replacement.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest without comparisons.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is borderline enlargement of the heart.  Within the right
     lower lung zone, there is a 4 mm, rounded and well-demarcated opacity.
     Additionally, on the lateral view there is a 1 cm opacity overlying the
     anterior portion of the approximately T10 vertebral body.  No other pulmonary
     opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.  Degenerative change within the
     spine is noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
     2)  Borderline cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
     3)  Two pulmonary opacities are identified.  If this may make a difference in
     the clinical management of the patient, a CT of the chest would be recommended
     to help characterize and localize these lesions.

ADMITTING DIAGNSOIS:
Severe aortic stenosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Severe aortic stenosis, status post an aortic valve
replacement with the 21 mm pericardial valve.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7220**] is an 82 year-old
gentleman who recently developed syncope.  He underwent an
echocardiogram which showed he had severe aortic stenosis
with a valve area of 0.8 cm sq.  He was found on several
subsequent cardiac catheterizations to have mild single
vessel coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular
function and normal pulmonary artery pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Recently diagnosed hypertension.
2) Recent onset of atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include 1) amiodarone 400 mg by
mouth once per day.  2) aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7220**] has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7220**] [**Last Name (Titles) 263**] a smoking history other
than briefly in college.  He report occasional consumption of
alcohol and no use of other illicit substances.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 7220**] was found to be afebrile with a heart rate of 63 in
sinus rhythm, a blood pressure of 113/57 with a respiratory
rate of 20.  His height was 5 feet, 10 inches, and his weight
was 157 pounds.  He was a pleasant 82 year-old male, who was
alert and oriented to person, place and time, and in no acute
distress.  His skin was warm and dry.  His neck was supple,
with the trachea in the midline and no lymphadenopathy.  He
did not have any visible jugular venous distention, and his
carotid pulses were 1+ palpable, and he had no audible
bruits.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1 and S2, and a 5 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
His abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended, with no
hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  His extremities
are warm and dry with no peripheral edema.  Neurologically
his gross motor and sensory examinations were found to be
intact.  On pulse examination he was found to have a 1+
palpable femoral, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and
radial pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Was significant for a CBC
which showed a white blood count of 5.8, hematocrit of 36 and
a platelet count of 157,000.  His chem-7 shows sodium of 137,
potassium of 4.2, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of28, BUN of
265 and a creatinine of 1.2 with a blood glucose of 204.  His
INR was 1.1.  He had an electrocardiogram which showed sinus
rhythm with a first degree AV block.  He also had some ST-T
segment flattening in the inferior leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7220**] was admitted to the operating
room on [**2804-12-27**], where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a 21 mm pericardial valve.  Please refer to
the dictated operative note for full details of this
procedure.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on drips of
Neo-Synephrine, propofol, and amiodarone.  He was at this
time also A-V paced.  On admission to the cardiac surgery
recovery unit [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Known patient lastname 7220**] was on propofol, and A-V paced at a
rate of 80.  His underlying rhythm was initially complete
heart block and converted to sinus bradycardia in the low
50s.  There was no ectopy noted.  His blood pressure
continued to fluctuate significantly requiring both
Neo-Synephrine and nitroglycerin at varying times to maintain
his blood pressures.  His cardiac enzyme was between 2 and 3.
 He was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and
given two units of fresh frozen plasma as well.  He had a
slight amount of serous drainage from his sternotomy incision
but this appeared stable.  He at this time also acidotic for
which he was given 2 ampules of sodium bicarbonate.  He was
also started on Kefzol.  On postoperative day number one he
continued to be on amiodarone drip and Neo-Synephrine drip.
His heart was being A_V paced to a rate of 80 and his blood
pressure was found to be 108/52.  His hematocrit following
the previous day's transfusions was 28.7 and he had an INR of
1.2 and a PTT of 39.9.  He was also maintained for a short
time on an insulin drip secondary to persistently elevated
blood glucose levels. Patient was extubated on postoperative
day number one and by postoperative day two had been weaned
from his Neo-Synephrine, amiodarone and insulin drips.  He
was started on oral amiodarone and was being treated for his
elevated blood sugars with sliding scale of regular insulin.
His chest tube was also removed at this time.  He had a brief
run of atrial fibrillation in the morning of postoperative
day number three, which converted spontaneously back into
sinus bradycardia.  He was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four in stable condition.  His
rhythm remained in sinus with excellent blood pressure
control.  He was see at this time in consultation by the
[**Hospital 7221**] Clinic as hie blood sugars had bee elevated
perioperatively.  It was determined that he had probably been
an untreated type 2 diabetic, and it was recommended that he
be started on a low dose of Glipizide.  He continued to
progress and do extremely well with no periods of confusion.
He worked very well with physical therapy, and was cleared by
them to be able to return home with no issue.  His cardiac
medications were continually titrated to optimize his cardiac
medication regimen.  He is at this time stable and ready for
discharge home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:  His physical
examination is significant for temperature of 97.9 degrees
Fahrenheit, heart rate of 80 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure
of 110/60 with an oxygen saturation of 96 percent on room
air.  He is pleasant, alert and oriented to person, place and
time, and in no acute distress.  His neck is supple with no
jugular venous distension or lymphadenopathy.  His heart
shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2.  His
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His extremities
are warm and dry with no extremity edema.  His sternotomy
incision is healing nicely with no erythema or drainage, and
he has good sternal stability.  His CBC at the time of
discharge is significant for white blood cell count of
108,000.  His chem-7 is significant for a sodium of 138,
potassium of 4.4, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 29, BUN of
26 and creatinine of 1.1.  His glucose is 109, and is
magnesium is 1.9.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1) Glipizide XL 2.5 mg by mouth
once per day, 2) Captopril 6.25 mg by mouth three time per
day to be held for systolic blood pressure of less than 100,
heart rate of less than 60, 3) Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth
twice per day, 4) potassium chloride 20 mg by mouth twice per
day, 5) amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day, 6) iron
sulfate 326 mg by mouth once per day, 7) ascorbic acid 500 mg
by mouth twice per day, 8) Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four
hours by moth for pain, 9) Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per
day.  10) Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice per day to be taken for
one additional week, 11) Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per
day.

DIET:  Should be a diabetic diet consistent
carbohydrate/cardiac healthy diet.

     PORTABLE CHEST [**2804-12-27**] COMPARED TO [**2804-12-15**]
     
     CLINICAL INDICATION:  S/P aortic valve replacement and surgery.  Evaluate for
     pneumothorax.
     
     There has been interval median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement
     procedure.  An endotracheal tube is present, terminating at the thoracic inlet
     level approximately 7 cm above the carina.  Note is made of slight over
     distention of the cuff of the tube.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the
     region of the proximal main pulmonary artery.  Mediastinal drains are noted.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in
     technique.  There is some increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region.
     The lungs otherwise appear clear.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
     evident.  There is a very small left apical pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Very small left apical pneumothorax.
     
     2)  Left retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis in this recently
     post-operative patient.
     
     3)  Slight over distention of endotracheal tube cuff.
