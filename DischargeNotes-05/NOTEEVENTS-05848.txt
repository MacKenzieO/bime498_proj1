Admission Date:  [**3267-11-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**3267-11-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**3200-10-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  O-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male with
a history advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
status post partial axillary lymph node resection after local
spread, who was then treated with carboplatin and
doxorubicin, and presented with left axillary pain and
drainage as well as an increased white blood cell count to
clinic on [**11-15**] for his weekly doxorubicin dose.  He
was afebrile at that point but started on Keflex for a
question of cellulitis.  Two days later he became febrile and
weak, and his white blood cell count increased from 20 to 40.
He noted no increase in his left axillary pain or redness.
He noted no cough, no shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

He presented to the Emergency Department where he was
hemodynamically stable and received Ancef.  He was admitted
for workup.  He became hypotensive and hypoglycemic, so he
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  There, he
responded to fluids with an increase in his blood pressure
and improved urine output.  He did not require pressors.  His
initial chest x-ray was negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Psoriasis for the past 40 years that was treated with
PUVA.
2.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; multiple skin
lesions, complications of PUVA treatment, status post
resection of many of the lesions.  A left arm cutaneous
lesion was removed by wide local excision in [**3266-11-19**]
and then he underwent radiation therapy to the area.  It was
a moderately to poorly differentiated tumor on histology.  He
had a recurrent left axillary lymph node which was partially
resected in [**3267-6-19**].  His metastatic without at this
time was negative.  He then underwent four cycles of
carboplatin and doxorubicin.  His carboplatin was stopped for
an increased creatinine.  He is currently still on the
doxorubicin but has been dose adjusted for his renal failure.
3.  Diabetes, on Amaryl.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
7.  Glaucoma.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Keflex since [**3267-11-15**],
Univasc, Amaryl, hydrochlorothiazide, morphine, Coumadin 1 mg
p.o. q.d. for Port-A-Cath prophylaxis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His sister died of lung cancer, and his
brother died of a myocardial infarction at age 57.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired priest who lives in his old
[**Doctor Last Name 7257**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This was a pleasant
obese man in no apparent distress, who was afebrile with a
temperature of 97.2, blood pressure of 72/35 to 90/50, pulse
of 55, and a respiratory rate of 20.  His oxygen saturation
was 93% on room air.  He head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination was unremarkable.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  His left axilla was warm with a purplish hue to skin
and chronic skin changes with surrounding erythema.  There
was a firm 5-cm X 5-cm nodular area with a fluctuant portion
just anterior.  There was a small break in the skin at the
site of his old [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drain from his axillary
dissection that was weeping with yellow drainage.  His heart
was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  His abdomen
was benign.  His extremities were without edema and with good
distal pulses.  His neurologic examination revealed intact
cranial nerves, 5/5 strength bilaterally in all four
extremities, and normal sensation bilaterally.  His skin
examination revealed multiple lesions, namely the stigmata of
PUVA treatment.  There was no active scoriatic lesions.  He
had a brown scabrous lesion on his left shin.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories revealed a
white blood cell count of 42.2, with a differential of 85%
neutrophils, 1% bands, and 2% lymphocytes.  His hematocrit
was 31.3 (which was at his baseline).  His platelet count
was 387.  He had normal electrolytes and glucose.  His blood
urea nitrogen was 40, and his creatinine was 1.8 (which was
up from his baseline of 1.4 to 1.7).  His liver function
tests were within normal limits.  His albumin was 3.8.  His
calcium was 10.1.  His urinalysis was positive for protein
and occasional bacteria, but otherwise negative.  His urine
culture was negative.  His wound culture was negative.  His
blood cultures were negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was negative for acute
airspace disease.

Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats
per minute with no acute changes.

A chest CT was  performed which showed left axillary necrotic
area with a peripheral enhancing lesion as well as a small
right axillary and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Father [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit and started on broad spectrum antibiotics
as well as hydrated with normal saline.  His blood pressure,
creatinine, and urine output improved overnight.  He did not
require pressors.  He was then transferred to the floor.

His hydrochlorothiazide, Univasc, and Amaryl were held as he
was normoglycemic and normotensive.  He was started on
vancomycin and ceftazidime and received five days of those
antibiotics before being changed to levofloxacin and
clindamycin p.o.  The plan was for a 2-week course of p.o.
antibiotics for a total course of 19 days of antibiotics.

The surgeon who performed his partial left axillary lymph
node resection was consulted and came to see him and evaluate
him.  She noted that he was not a surgical candidate for
further resection but thought that radiologic drainage of his
axillary mass could be helpful.

A dedicated axillary CT was performed which showed a mass
which central fluid collection with a question of necrotic
lymph node core.  This was then drained under
ultrasound-guidance of serosanguineous fluid that was culture
negative but cytology positive for malignant cells.  His
doxorubicin was continued every week as prior to admission.

After he was switched to p.o. antibiotics, he was sent home
to complete his course with close Visiting Nurse [**First Name (Titles) 7258**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7131**] for blood pressure and temperature checks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was improved.
