ADDENDUM:  This is a continuation of the Discharge Summary.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):  The patient was
transferred to the Unit for close monitoring of blood
pressure, and an arterial line was placed.  The patient was
placed on a nicardipine drip for management of blood
pressure.  The patient's Intensive Care Unit course was
unremarkable.  The patient's blood pressure was well
controlled and was weaned off the drip.

Plastic Surgery, Oral Maxillofacial, and Ophthalmology all
concluded nonoperative management for the orbital fractures.

The patient was transferred to the floor in a stable
condition on post trauma day three.  The patient's cervical
spine was cleared, and a swallowing evaluation was obtained.
The patient failed the swallowing study, and tube feeds were
started.

The [**Hospital 1032**] hospital course was remarkable for an
additional head computed tomography which showed an interval
improvement in the right subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Throughout
the hospital course, the patient had nutritional issues, and
aspiration precautions were made.  The patient was not
motivated to follow commands or swallowing studies, and the
patient was kept nothing by mouth for this reason.  Each day
the patient was more and more alert, and the patient was
unable to pass a bedside swallow evaluation times two.

All these issues were discussed with the patient's son, who
insisted that the patient should attempt oral intake as he
did prior to admission.  The risks of aspiration pneumonia
were told to the patient's son, and the patient's agreed to
accept these risks and wanted his father to try oral intake.
In addition, the possibility of percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube placement was discussed with the son who
adamantly refused this.

The patient discontinued his own feeding tubes on post trauma
day six.  As per the son, the patient was started on thick
liquids for a trial of oral intake.

A Geriatric consultation was obtained to comment on
management of by mouth status.  They recommended attempts at
oral intake with the son's recommendations.

On post trauma day eleven, the patient developed a
temperature of 101.4.  A urinalysis was sent, which was
negative.  White blood cell count was 13.6, and a chest x-ray
showed new right lower lobe infiltrate.  A sputum culture was
sent, and blood cultures were sent.

The Geriatric fellow who was following the patient suggested
transfer to Medicine at this time.  A sputum culture grew out
gram-negative and gram-positive rods, and the patient was
started on Zosyn.

At this time hospital course dictated by medical resident
should be continued as well as discharge instructions and
medications.
