Past Medical History:
Chronic hep B cirrhosis, DM, HTN
 
Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo M with h/o chronic hep B with cirrhosis, HTN, DM, 
transferred from [**Hospital1 1262**] for management of esophageal varix bleed 
and possible transplant evaluation.  Patient initially 
progressed with medical management and extubated, but suffered 
from worsening hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome 
and was listed for transplant.  He then had recurrent GI bleed, 
underwent EGD and [**Last Name (un) 1554**] tube placement.

He also had presumed sepsis and went into multi-system organ 
failure.  He was ventilator dependent, on multiple vasopressors, 
in liver failure, in renal failure on CVVHD and coagulopathic 
requiring blood product.  He was removed from the transplant 
recipient list.  After extensive discussion with the wife and 
family, care was withdrawn per their wishes.

     HISTORY:  SOB.  Tube placement.
     
     AP BEDSIDE UPRIGHT CHEST.  The heart is borderline enlarged.  Slight plethora
     of pulmonary vasculature probably reflects size and positioning and no overt
     CHF.  The left lower lobe behind the heart is opacified and there is patchy
     atelectasis elsewhere in both lungs.  Left CP angle not visualized.  ET tube
     is satisfactorily positioned in the lower trachea.  Slightly dilated
     gas-filled stomach is noteworthy in light of ET tube placement but esophageal
     intubation unlikely.  No comparison exams on PACS.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe atelectasis and I cannot exclude associated
     consolidation and/or effusion.  No CHF.

   the pt continues to do well s/p extubation. serial hcts are stable with no evidence of any further bleeding. his diet has been advanced for this morning. his uop is improving as well although his creatinine level remains elevated at 3. lft's continue a downward trend although his chronic abd pain is subjectively worse this morning with an increase in abd distention. he denies any nausea.

review of systems

respiratory-> lung exam notable for left sided crackles. he is receiving abx coverage for lll pnx. he denies sob and is maintaining sats >95% on just 2 liters of o2 via cannula.

cardiac-> hemodynamically stable. hr 80-90's, sr with no noted ectopy. sbp ranging 100-120's. cvp readings [**8-3**].

neuro-> pt appears to be alert and oriented although his english is heavily accented and difficult to understand at times. he is consistently following commands. his mobility is significantly restricted by his anasarca and pitting, peripheral edema. 

gi-> abd is firm, more distended overnoc w/+bs. ?whether pt would benefit from another paracentesis. he continues to drain serous fluid from the old tap site. hcts stable, will advance diet to renal, low protein this morning. 

gu-> uop 20-90cc/hr. creat stable but elevated. uop improving overnoc, particularly after the pt has water to drink. would expect that the pt is still intravascularly depleted with relatively low cvp readings.

endocrine-> fs/bs ranging 130's overnoc. fs with sliding scale coverage changed to meal/bedtime schedule.

id-> tmin 97.4 orally. wbc wnl although pt has a positive bc from [**3-7**] growing out gpc. other cultures are pnding.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with end-stage liver disease.  Transplant
     candidate.  Evaluate for focal lesions.
     
     STUDY:  MRI liver without and with gadolinium.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained of the
     abdomen with focus on the liver followed by multiphase 3D T1-weighted gradient
     echo imaging before, during, and after gadolinium administration.  From these
     images, subtractions were made and multiplanar reformats viewed on an
     independent GE workstation.
     
     COMPARISON:  No MRI.
     
     FINDINGS:
     The study is slightly limited secondary to the patient's large volume of
     ascites.  The liver is slightly shrunken and has a markedly nodular contour
     consistent with cirrhosis.  The portal vein is patent and has hepatopetal
     flow.  There are no focal dominant liver lesions.  No abnormal enhancement on
     arterial phase imaging or other findings to suggest hepatocellular carcinoma.
     There is mild splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 14.6 cm in craniocaudal
     span.  There are large paraesophageal and gastric varices.  With massive
     ascites, the patient has all major sequela of portal hypertension.  No
     significant perihepatic lymphadenopathy.
     
     There are multiple small gallstones dependently within the gallbladder.
     Gallbladder wall is mildly thickened, likely related to liver failure.  No
     intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  No filling defects
     within the bile ducts to suggest choledocholithiasis.  Pancreas is normal in
     signal characteristics and contour.  The main pancreatic duct is not dilated.
     No evidence of pancreatic lesions.  The adrenal glands are normal in
     appearance bilaterally.  Other than a simple renal cyst, the kidneys are
     normal in appearance.  No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  No concerning
     marrow lesions.  There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases.  No large
     pericardial or pleural effusions.
     
     Multiplanar reformats and subtraction images were helpful in evaluating the
     liver and organs of the upper abdomen.

     INDICATION:  Followup study to exclude small-bowel obstruction.  Study
     performed earlier demonstrated that the contrast did not reach the colon yet.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast.  Oral contrast
     was pre-administered to the prior study.
     
     FINDINGS:  In the interval, the contrast has moved, reaching the colon.  There
     is no evidence of small bowel obstruction.  The small bowel is of normal
     caliber.  As described before, there is thickening of the colon and the
     stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of small bowel obstruction.
     2.  Thickening of the colon and stomach.  Given the overall anasarca, this
     finding is likely due to edema from low albumin.  However, colitis cannot be
     completely excluded on the basis of this study.

     obstruction.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to MR abdomen from [**2885-3-13**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast only.  IV contrast
     was not administered.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  There is atelectasis versus
     scarring in the right base.  There is a pleural-based patchy opacity
     anteriorly in the middle lobe of unclear significance.  It could represent
     atelectatic changes.  Differential diagnosis would include a pneumonia and
     infarct.
     
     There are multiple stones within the gallbladder.  The liver is irregular
     consistent with the history of cirrhosis.  There is a large amount of ascites.
     The spleen is of normal size.  However, multiple splenic and esophageal
     varices are seen.  Small bowel loops are slightly increased in caliber
     measuring up to 2.8 cm.  The contrast did not yet reach the colon.  Followup
     CT scan could be performed to completely exclude the presence of obstruction.
     There is diffuse thickening of the colon which could be secondary to low
     albumin and third spacing.  However, presence of colitis cannot be excluded in
     this study and clinical correlation is recommended.  Small retroperitoneal
     mesenteric lymph nodes are seen.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY:  There is a follicle within the
     urinary bladder.  There is a large amount of fluid within the pelvis.  There
     is also fluid in the inguinal canal and scrotal sac consistent with very large
     hydrocele which could be communicating with the intraperitoneal fluid. High-
     density soft tissue mass within the left hemiscrotum likely representing
     testicle which is slightly retracted.  The right testicle was not included in

     HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease with bleeding esophageal varices status post
     placement of tube, question location.
     
     An AP supine portable chest radiograph shows a Sengstaken-[**Last Name (un) 629**] tube with
     the inflated balloon portion below the left hemidiaphragm measuring almost 9
     cm in diameter.  The distal end of the tube is projected rightward, directed
     towards or through the pylorus.  Endotracheal tube and right IJ central venous
     catheters appear in unchanged positions.  Central pulmonary vasculature
     appears crowded probably related to supine positioning and somewhat small lung
     volumes. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Sengstaken-[**Last Name (un) 629**] tube tip directed towards pylorus with
     esophageal balloon dilated to almost 9 cm (not accounting for magnification).
     Loop in tube seen on yesterday's study has straightened out.

     Two supine AP portable chest radiographs show that the patient's Swan-Ganz
     catheter placed from the left subclavian approach has been partially withdrawn
     approximately 2.5 cm and the tip is now at the level of the right main
     pulmonary artery. Right IJ central venous catheter and endotracheal tube
     remain in unchanged positions. The patient's Sengstaken-[**Last Name (un) 629**] tube balloon
     remains inflated to the same degree, however it is probably free within the
     cardia of the stomach, not pulled up against the GE junction.  Some minimal
     right upper lobe atelectasis is an unchanged finding.  Air bronchograms
     persist in the left retrocardiac region.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Swan-Ganz catheter tip pulled back approximately 2.5 cm with the
     tip now about mid-to-distal right main pulmonary artery.
