Admission Date:  [**2619-1-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2619-2-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2566-11-2**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company **]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old woman
with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma stage II, status
post radiation in [**2609**] who was diagnosed with right lung
adenocarcinoma with fine-needle aspiration in [**2618-6-22**]
after CT scan revealed a right lung mass in the setting of
elevated tumor marker with CEA up to 16.4.  The CT revealed a
mass of 2.5 cm by 5 cm in the right upper lobe.  She had a
PET scan which staged cancer as stage III A or B at [**Hospital3 5943**].  She had three runs of chemo which was stopped in
[**2618-8-23**] secondary to hemolytic anemia but she did
complete a course of XRT.

She has been hospitalized at an outside hospital several
times since [**2618-10-23**] for recurrent episodes of
fevers, progressive pulmonary infiltrates and most recently
intractable nausea and vomiting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was initially thought to have
radiation-induced pneumonitis for which she was treated with
steroids, but she also received Levaquin for presumptive
pneumonia.  She has been on steroids for chemo-induced
hemolytic anemia and radiation-induced pneumonitis.  She also
received several transfusions for hemolytic anemia.

On [**2618-12-31**], she had bronchioloalveolar lavage which
revealed Aspergillus and [**Female First Name (un) 434**] and possible atypical
Mycobacteria.  Hyphae was seen in cytology but the path was
not sufficient for evaluation of invasive Aspergillus.  Her
AFB studies had remained negative until bronchoalveolar
lavage on [**2619-1-20**] which grew out positive atypical
Mycobacteria (Gordonii) for which she was started on
itraconazole on [**2619-1-2**] for possible invasive
aspergillosis.  She was switched to Amphotericin B on [**2619-1-16**] secondary to failure to improve.  She was also
started on triple regimen on [**2619-1-20**] for atypical
Mycobacteria infection.  The triple regimen included
Rifabutin, ethambutol, and Clarithromycin, but the CT scan
showed progressive cavitary lesions in the upper right lower
lobe and dense consolidation in the base of right lower lobe.

She was started on vancomycin on [**2619-1-16**] after acute
aspiration episode but the vancomycin was discontinued on
[**2619-1-18**].  In addition, she was also started on
meropenem on [**2619-1-16**] for Enterobacter UTI.

Her most recent admission to the outside hospital on [**2619-1-10**] was notable for intractable nausea and vomiting.
She had an EGD which revealed gastritis.  She continued to
have intermittent fevers and a persistent productive cough of
greenish sputum with right-sided chest pain but without
hemoptysis.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for further workup
of the right lower lobe process including possible open lung
biopsy.  She had repeated fine-needle aspiration of the right
lower lobe cavitary lesion but the results were inconclusive.
She is followed by both ID and the Pulmonary Service.

She continued to have intermittent fevers and a persistent
productive cough with right-sided chest pain.  Since her
symptoms had no response to the broad antibiotic coverage and
her cultures here remained unremarkable, triple antibiotics
for atypical bacterial infection were discontinued and
meropenem and the vancomycin were switched to levofloxacin
and clindamycin to cover likely postobstructive pneumonia.
Amphotericin B was also switched to p.o. voriconazole for
possible invasive aspergillosis.

After a long discussion between Infectious Disease, Pulmonary
and Thoracic Surgery, the decision was made not to pursue
open lung biopsy given her critical condition.  She was
scheduled to go for a bronchoscopy on [**2619-2-5**] for
both diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic stenting of the
collapsed bronchial.

Unfortunately, the patient went into respiratory failure in
the early morning of [**2619-2-5**].  She was intubated on
the floor and was transferred to the VICU for further care as
the patient remained full code at that time.  However, the
patient continued to deteriorate and required pressors for
blood pressure support.

Given her overall poor prognosis, after a long discussion
with the family, the decision was made to withdrawal care at
that time.  The patient passed away peacefully on [**2619-2-5**] in the presence of her family.

     ADDENDUM:  Rereview of the images reveals a 5 mm diameter well circumscribed
     lung nodule in the periphery of the left lower lobe.  In a patient with known
     primary neoplasm, differential diagnosis includes a focus of metastatic
     disease vs. a benign nodule such as a noncalcified granuloma or intrapulmonary
     lymph node.  Comparison to any outside studies would be helpful to determine
     retrospective stability of this finding.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right cavitary lesion in patient with lung adenocarcinoma.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT scanning of the chest without IV contrast.  There is no prior
     CT available for comparison.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There are mildly prominent lymph nodes in the
     superior mediastinum and right paratracheal regions. There are more grossly
     enlarged nodes in the right hilum and subcarinal regions.  The pulmonary
     artery is enlarged, with pulmonary hypertension.  Overall heart size is at the
     upper limits of normal.  There is minimal pericardial thickening or a tiny
     effusion.
     
     Lung windows demonstrate paramediastinal areas of volume loss and air
     bronchograms, consistent with radiation fibrosis.  In addition, there is
     subtotal consolidation of the right lower lobe.  In the superior segment of
     the right lower lobe, there is a large cavity containing internal debris.  The
     cavity has a thick wall, particularly medially, which is concerning for a
     malignant etiology.  No fluid levels are apparent.  There is a small pleural
     effusion adjacent to the cavitary lesion.
     
     In the upper abdomen, there are multiple large calcified gallstones.  The
     spleen is enlarged.  No focal splenic or hepatic lesions are identified. The
     adrenal glands are normal.  Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic
     lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Thick-walled cavitary lesion in the superior segment of the right lower
     lobe with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  The degree of
     lymphadenopathy surrounding the right hilum raises the concern for neoplasm.
     The presence of consolidation in the right lower lobe suggests the presence of
     an infection and containment by the major fissure is not consistent with
     radiation fibrosis at this site. Associated large right lower lobe cavity is
     noted and could be due to cavitating infection (e.g. bacterial lung abscess or
     TB) or cavitating neoplasm.
     2. Bilateral pulmonary radiation fibrosis (separate from right lower lobe
     consolidation).
     
                                                                 (Over)

     There are no prior studies available for comparison.
     
     AP CHEST:  Evaluation is limited without comparison studies. There is
     cardiomegaly without evidence of failure. There is a large, cavitary, right
     upper lobe mass, with associated atelectasis. There is fullness in the right
     hilum, which likely represents the patient's known adenocarcinoma, with
     collapse/consolidation of the right lower lobe.  There is also increased
     opacity within the left hilar region, extending up into the left upper lobe,
     which is suspicious for cross mediastinal extension of tumor.  The osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Large cavitary lung mass in right upper lobe, increased opacity
     in bilateral hilar regions.  Collapse/consolidation of right lower lobe.
     Evaluation limited without prior studies for comparison.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Cavitary right upper lobe lesion.
     
     The procedure was fully explained to the patient and informed signed consent
     was obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion
     and 1% Lidocaine was used as local anesthetic.
     
     Conscious sedation and continuous monitoring was provided by the radiology
     nurse.
     
     Preliminary unenhanced chest CT examination demonstrates a cavitary lesion in
     the right upper lobe, unchanged in appearance from the prior CT examination of
     [**2619-1-26**].
     
     Using CT fluoroscopy for guidance, a 19 gauge by 14.7 cm coaxial needle was
     introduced into the periphery of the lesion from the posterior approach.  A 20
     gauge by 20 cm Franseen needle was used for fine needle aspiration times 7.
     Specimens were given to cytology for immediate evaluation.  Specimens were
     also sent to microbiology.
     
     Post procedure limited chest CT demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     CT FLUOROSCOPY:  CT fluoroscopy was used for guidance of the needle into the
     periphery of the cavitary lesion.  A total of 15 minutes of CT fluoroscopy
     time was utilized.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Successful fine needle aspiration biopsy of cavitary lesion.
     
     [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3422**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3423**], attending radiologist, was present for the entirety of the

     LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VEINS ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler sonograms of
     the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial and basilic veins
     were performed.  Normal waveforms, compressibility and augmentation were
     demonstrated.  No definite intraluminal thrombus was identified.  Note that
     the internal jugular/subclavian vein junction was not well visualized on the
     present study, but normal venous waveforms in these vessels makes the
     likelihood of an occlusive thrombus very unlikely.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an occlusive deep venous thrombosis of the left
     upper extremity, as discussed above.
