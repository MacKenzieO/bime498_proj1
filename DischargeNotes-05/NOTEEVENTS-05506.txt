IMPRESSION:  Patient is an 83-year-old male with coronary
artery disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, ICD
biventricular pacer, now with left IJ thrombosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Heme.  The patient has a left IJ thrombosis unclear due
to hypocoagulable state or due to sub-therapeutic Coumadin
and clot may be related to pacer wire.  The patient was
evaluated by EP Department who felt that the clot was due to
the pacer placement and not due to hypercoagulable state and
recommended anti-coagulation.  The patient was continued on
Coumadin and was started on Lovenox and had a hypercoagulable
workup which was unrevealing.  In the setting of Coumadin and
Lovenox with an INR of around 4, the patient evolved a
massive gastrointestinal bleed with hematocrit drop to 15.
The patient was started on peripheral fluids as well as a
left femoral cortise insertion with transfusion of 6 units of
blood, 4 units of FFP.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for management where he required several
additional units of blood and FFP for reversal of the
Coumadin as well as keeping up with the iron blood loss due
to the gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient underwent Nasogastric lavage which showed maroon
returns and passed several melanotic stools.  After reversal
of the Coumadin and with transfusion of blood, the patient
began to have slowing of his gastrointestinal bleed and it
was decided not to pursue further anti-coagulation as the
Deep vein thrombosis was in the upper extremities and was not
likely to embolize the pulmonary embolus.  Also was not
likely to extend along the pacer wire given its current
position.

At time of discharge the patient is not to be placed on
anti-coagulation and this may be revisited in two to three
weeks time.

2.  Gastrointestinal.  As above.  The patient was evaluated
by esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed initially clots in
the stomach, was re-evaluate with esophagogastroduodenoscopy
again which showed the patient had a gastric ulcer, this was
evaluated again by H. pylori antibody which was negative so
the patient was placed on Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was
not treated for infectious etiology for the ulcer.

Re-evaluation with esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done again
as the patient's crit tended to drop slowly over the course
of his hospital stay requiring transfusions about once a week
and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed findings consistent
with watermelon stomach or GAVE.  Treatment for which was
initiated with Argon coagulation.  This will need to be
repeated in three to four weeks time for re-coagulation.
After the procedure the patient was transfused another unit
of blood and his hematocrit has been stable since then.  For
now he is to continue on a proton pump inhibitor and is not
to be started on any anti-coagulation or steroid.

3.  Gout.  In the setting of diuretic use with multiple
components of FFP transfused the patient had a significant
amount of diuretics administered likely causing exacerbation
of his gout in both knees, his feet as well as right wrist
causing severe pain and it was felt by the Rheumatology
consult that helped to inject his joints with steroids, the
left knee was injected for pain relief however, the patient
declined any further injections of steroids.  Fluid analysis
was consistent with urate crystals in the synovium of the
left knee.  Will not be possible at this time to continue
with steroids for the reasons mentioned above in systemic
dosing.  Allopurinol will be continued at 100 mg p.o. q day
for renal dosing.  However, Colchicine will not likely
provide benefit at the small doses that would be given due to
his renal failure.  Similarly NSAIDs would also be
contraindicated due to the renal failure.

4.  Cardiovascular.  The patient did have congestive heart
failure exacerbation due to the significant amount of volume
transfused and was diuresed with 80 mg intravenous b.i.d.
with Lasix with good effect and on discharge, is now sating
significantly better on room air and not feeling
significantly short of breath.  Will continue Lasix at 80 mg
p.o. b.i.d. for outpatient dosing for congestive heart
failure and Enalapril was discontinued due to renal failure,
the patient will continue on Hydralazine and long-acting
nitrates.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Watermelon stomach.
2.  Gastric ulcer.
3.  Left IJ thrombosis.
4.  Gout flare.
5.  Congestive heart failure systolic dysfunction.
6.  Status post massive gastrointestinal bleed.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy who noted that he was unable to walk on his own even
with significant assistance.  He is severely deconditioned
and will require a stay in rehabilitation for improving his
deconditioning and helping with ambulation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 6 p.r.n.
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.o. q day p.r.n.
5.  Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q day.

Neuro: Pt too sedated initially. Midaz turned down from 1.5mg/hr to 1mg/hr and fentanyl turned down to 50mcg due to pt's resp rate being so low when vent changed to PSV. Pt opens eyes to commands and opened mouth for mouth care to commands. 

CV: BP 110-130/60. HR 60-80. Paced rhythm. We are giving him IV D5w at 75cc/hr to try to correct hypernatremia. Last Na was 144 and the order is to continue IVF at 75cc/hr for another 500cc's. CVP was [**9-28**]. Pt given lasix 20mg with minimal effect prior to first unit of blood. Given 40mg IV lasix before second unit of blood. Better effect from the 40mg being noted.

Resp: Pt weaned to PSV 20 with 5cm peep and 30% FIO2 with good ABG. Later this eve pt weaned to PSV 15. ABG needs to be drawn by the team. Lungs are coarse with deminished sounds throughout. RR now 20-24. TV 250-260.

GI/Heme: Hct was 27 today and due to pt's history of cardiac disease the decision was made to transfuse two units slowly. He is due for repeat hct 4hrs after second unit finishes which means his hct will be due around the time of AM labs.

GU: UO was poor via foley and despite numerous attempts to irrigate and manipulate foley it drained very sporadically. It seemed to be positional. I spoke to team about this and ended up changing the foley to larger one which is draining better.

CCU Nursing Progress Note:
Pt switched to CCU service this evening. Pt swaned at bedside. Remains sedated on fetanyl and versed and will remain in MICU as CCU border.

Neuro: Pt nods head yes and no to simple questions. Grimaces to pain. Has a great cough and gag. Has a lot of grimacing as if in pain when moved even a little bit. He has very stiff extremities.

Resp: Lungs are coarse. No vent changes made. Pt remains on 10PSV with 5cm peep FIO2 30%. Suctioned for thick pale yellow secretions once.

CV: Swan placed in right IJ with out difficulty. Swan trace is good. Initial readings 58/23 wedge 22 and CVP 11-12. CO by FICK was 4.0 and CI 2.21. SVR 1300 when the natracor was at .1mcg/kg/min. After these readings drip was increased to .2mcg/kg and pt was given lasix 80mg at 8:15PM. Repeat readings done at 9PM showed PAP 52/20 wedge 16 and CVP 8. Will repeat FICK CO at 10PM. HR remains 70-90 paced rhythm with some ectopy. BP 100-110/50. He continues on heparin drip at 750u/hr. Drip was held during swan insertion and restarted at about 8PM. Repeat PTT needs to be drawn at 2AM tonight. They ordered surface echo stat but I doubt that this will be done tonight.

GI: Tube feeds of full strength probalance at 65cc/hr (GOAL) tolerated well. No stool. Pt on colace.

GU: Urine is burgandy with small clots noted. Foley irrigated manually to make sure it is patent which it is. This has been a [**Last Name 248**] problem this admission with it ending up with new foley insertion this AM by urology. It does seem to be flowing at this point but needs to be monitored for patency/flow frequently.

ID: Pt afebrile.

Skin: Pt turned once. Duoderm is intact on coccyx.

Social: Pt's daughter was contacted for consent for swan and was updated at that time by team.

Resp :  Pt continues on 4L NC.  BS cl most of the day.  Pt has weak productive cough and suctioning out white secretions from mouth with yankauer.  Remains tachyneic and occasionally c/o feeling SOB.  Feels better after resp treatments given.  O2Sat drops to 87-88% on RA but raises quickly back to 99% when back on NC.  CXR shows diffuse pulm edema.

CV - Pt having more frequent runs of vtach this am.  K 3.4  given 40 kcl via NGT and given 40kcl iv over 2 hours.  No dramatic decrease of ectopy noted.  Given 2.5 mg lopressor with min results.  Decreased dobut to 1.5 mcg and pt continues to have frequent ectopy but no more long runs.  K presently 4.6.  Hct 27 - recieving 1 unit prbc's.  BP stable throughout vtach episodes.  SG still in - plan to aggresively diurese tonight and hopefully dc SG [**9-13**].  Afebrile.  

GI - Tolerating TF's well.  Pt pulled NGT X2 and it was replaced X2.  Waiting reading of CXR prior to starting TF again.  Pt passing mod to large amt liquid foul smelling stool.  Mushroom cath placed.

GU - continues on CBI.  Only a few small clots noted.  Leaking around meatus has decreased dramatically.  Difficult to get very accurate UO but bleeding appears to be getting under control at this point.

Neuro - Awake and alert.  Occasionally confused but easily reoriented to time and place.  MAE - physical therapy worked with him and he tolerated it very well.  He does seem to be getting ""fed up"" with certain things and may need to be restrained lightly to prevent him from pulling things out.

Skin - duoderm not staying on coccyx area but area is smaller and looking quite healthy.  Left open to air.  

A:  Increased ectopy
    Bladder bleeding improving.

P:  Continue CBI and adjust rate as necessary
    Monitor lytes closely and replace K as needed
    Continue to evaluate neuro status for increased confusion - may need to be restrained to prevent pulling of lines.
