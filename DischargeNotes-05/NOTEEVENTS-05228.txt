                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: Severe back pain.
     
     AP and lateral views of the L/S spine. There is loss of height of the superior
     portion of L2 which is non-symmetric involving predominantly the left side of
     this body with extensive sclerosis. There are associated calcifications in the
     adjacent soft tissues. Generalized demineralization with all vertebral bodies
     showing biconcavity in lateral projection. No discrete areas of bone
     destruction and pedicles intact including those of L2. The poorly visualized
     hips are probably normal as are the SI joints. Extensive bilateral pleural
     calcifications. Posterior degenerative changes in the facet joints of the
     lower lumbar spine with probably diminution in the AP diameter of the spinal
     canal. No acute fracture identified. Since similar examination [**2573-1-5**] the
     loss of T2 height and sclerosis have progressed.
     
     IMPRESSION: Unusual T2 fracture which has progressed but I doubt pathologic
     etiology other than osteoporosis. Asbestos exposure. No bone destruction.
     Possible spinal stenosis.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY: 89 year old man with back pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial 7 mm images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained before
     and after the administration of 100 cc Optiray per fast bolus technique.
     
     There are no prior CTs available for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:
     CT ABDOMEN W/O&W IV CONTRAST: The heart is enlarged, there are coronary artery
     calcifications.  Also noted are pericardial calcifications and a small amount
     of fluid within the pericardium.  There are extensive bilateral pleural
     calcifications, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
     than left.  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The right lower lobe is partially
     atelectatic.
     
     The liver is normal in size, without evidence of focal lesions.  The
     gallbladder is present, there is high attenuation material in the dependent
     portion which may represent tiny gallstones.  The pancreas is atrophic, the
     common bile duct is slightly prominent at the level of the head of the
     pancreas, there is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The right kidney is
     normal.  The left kidney has two small low attenuation lesions consistent with
     cysts.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
     
     There is extensive soft tissue density material surrounding a large infrarenal
     aortic aneurysm which measures approximately 8 x 7 x 10 cm.  The aneurysm ends
     before the bifurcation, both iliac arteries appear ectatic, especially the
     right proximal portion.  Contrast enhanced CT is suggestive of a contained
     leak which extends towards the right posterior aspect of the aneurysm and is
     best seen in series three, image 24.  There is a second contained collection
     which is posterior to the one described that enhances during the arterial
     phase and probably represents part of this contained leak.  The extensive
     stranding of the soft tissue surrounding the aneurysm extends along the psoas
     muscle and anterior to the aorta.  There is intraabdominal free fluid
     surrounding the liver and within the pelvis.  Loops of small bowel and large
     bowel are not dilated.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O&W IV CONTRAST:   The bladder and both ureters are  normal.  The
     prostate is unremarkable.  There are extensive degenerative changes throughout
     the spine and in bilateral SI joints.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     2 VIEWS CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: Symptoms of pneumonia.
     
     The heart is enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is a very large hiatal
     hernia present.
     
     The pulmonary vascularity appears attenuated in the upper lobes, suggesting
     background emphysema. There are numerous calcified pleural plaques
     bilaterally. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. There is some
     volume loss in the right lower lobe with inferior
     displacement of fissure and right hilum.
     
     The bones demonstrate diffuse demineralization.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral calcified pleural plaques, consistent with previous
     asbestos exposure. 2) Small bilateral pleural effusions. 3) Large hiatal
     hernia. 4) Volume loss in right lung with fissural displacement and inferior
     displacement of right hilum. Comparison to older chest radiographs of [**2570-12-24**]
     is suggested when they become available (the prior films have been requested).

     CT ABDOMEN W/O&W IV CONTRAST: The heart is enlarged, there are coronary artery
     calcifications.  Also noted are pericardial calcifications and a small amount
     of fluid within the pericardium.  There are extensive bilateral pleural
     calcifications, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
     than left.  There is a large hiatal hernia.  The right lower lobe is partially
     atelectatic.
     
     The liver is normal in size, without evidence of focal lesions.  The
     gallbladder is present, there is high attenuation material in the dependent
     portion which may represent tiny gallstones.  The pancreas is atrophic, the
     common bile duct is slightly prominent at the level of the head of the
     pancreas, there is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The right kidney is
     normal.  The left kidney has two small low attenuation lesions consistent with
     cysts.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
     
     There is extensive soft tissue density material surrounding a large infrarenal
     aortic aneurysm which measures approximately 8 x 7 x 10 cm.  The aneurysm ends
     before the bifurcation, both iliac arteries appear ectatic, especially the
     right proximal portion.  Contrast enhanced CT is suggestive of a contained
     leak which extends towards the right posterior aspect of the aneurysm and is
     best seen in series three, image 24.  There is a second contained collection
     which is posterior to the one described that enhances during the arterial
     phase and probably represents part of this contained leak.  The extensive
     stranding of the soft tissue surrounding the aneurysm extends along the psoas
     muscle and anterior to the aorta.  There is intraabdominal free fluid
     surrounding the liver and within the pelvis.  Loops of small bowel and large
     bowel are not dilated.
     
     CT PELVIS W/O&W IV CONTRAST:   The bladder and both ureters are  normal.  The
     prostate is unremarkable.  There are extensive degenerative changes throughout
     the spine and in bilateral SI joints.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     Endotracheal tube is 4 cm above carina with prominencew of inflated cuff.
     Swan- Ganz catheter overlies main pulmonary artery . Introducer sheath is in
     the right brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax. Therearebilateral pleural
     thickening/plaques and calcifications in the diaphragmatic pleura indicative
     of prior asbestos exposure. Ill-defined loss of lucency in the right lung of
     uncertain significance in this rotated film. There is a large hiatal hernia.
     There is atelectasis at the left base. NG tube extends below diaphragm.
     
     IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Diffuse ill-defined opacity on right side
     possibly due to layering effusion on this supine film. Bilateral calcified
     pleural plaques and large hiatal hernia as described.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Ruptured AAA, decreased oxygen saturation.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  ETT is well-positioned.  The NGT courses into the stomach.
     There is a small amount of air adjacent to the NGT, likely within a hiatal
     hernia.  There has been interval removal of the right Swan-Ganz catheter.
     There remains right internal jugular cordis with tip in the right
     brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax.  There are bilateral pleural effusions
     and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is central opacity and indistinctness of the
     pulmonary vessels, representing mild CHF.  There are bilateral calcified
     pleural plaques.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Lines and tubes as above.  2)  Bilateral pleural effusions
     with bibasilar atelectasis.  3)  Mild CHF.  4)  No significant change in the
     lung fields compared with [**2574-9-11**].

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Change ETT.
     
     A single view of the chest was submitted. The ETT, right jugular introducer as
     well as the NGT are in the appropriate position.  The cardiomediastinal
     contours are difficult to assess because of patient rotation to the left.
     There is bilateral hazy opacity which obscured both hemidiaphragms.  These are
     unchanged from the prior examination.  There is no pneumothorax.  The osseous
     structures are grossly unremarkable.  There is calcific densities at both
     bases suggesting pleural plaques.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned ETT.  Bilateral stable pleural effusion.

     Comparison is made to previous study of two days earlier.
     
     A nasogastric tube is present, with the side port terminating well above the
     GE junction level and the distal tip near the thoracoabdominal junction.  ET
     tube is in satisfactory position.  There is a new right internal jugular
     central venous catheter present, which courses into the SVC.  No pneumothorax
     is identified.
     
     The heart is enlarged.  There is increased pulmonary vascularity and bilateral
     perhilar haziness.  There remain bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
     than left, superimposed upon diffuse areas of bilateral pleural calcification.
      There remains dense left retrocardiac opacification.

     right and small left pleural effusion, superimposed upon underlying changes of
     pleural plaque calcifications.
     
     No pneumothorax is identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Left subclavian central venous catheter enters left
     brachiocephalic vein but is not well demonstrated beyond this level.  Repeat
     non rotated view may be helpful to better assess catheter tip.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: AAA repair. Acute onset shortness of breath and tachycardia.
     Metabolic acidosis. 
     
     TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced abdominal and pelvic CT was followed by contrast
     enhanced chest, abdomen and pelvis. 150cc of Optiray were administered for
     indication of rapid bolus CTA. Multi planar reformations were created.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2574-9-9**] abdominal and pelvic CT.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy. The thoracic vessels are normal in contour and caliber. The
     pulmonary vessels are well opacified without evidence of emboli. There is a
     small to moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with associated compressive
     atelectasis of the dependent portion of the right lobe. Innumerable pleural
     based and diaphragmatic plaque calcifications are noted, consistent with
     history of asbestos exposure. On lung windows, there is a 3cm focus of
     reticular groundglass attenuation adjacent to the anterior pleura of the right
     upper lobe. This is non specific, but may represent parenchymal lung changes
     of asbestosis. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base and a minute
     pleural effusion. There is a large hiatal hernia.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver and spleen are normal in
     appearance. The gallbladder is distended, with the distal tip interposed
     between the inferior edge of the liver and the right antero-lateral abdominal
     wall. There is no evidence of obvious cholecystitis by CT criteria, although
     ultrasound would be more sensitive. There are three low attenuation foci in
     the pancreas, one in the tail and two in the head, measuring approximately 1cm
     each. Note that no calcifications were noted within the pancreas on unenhanced
     exam. There has been interval repair of the AAA. The stent extends from the
     infra-renal aorta to the iliac bifurcation. There is a heterogeneous
     collection anterior to the aorta, consistent with hematoma which
     interdigitates into the fat planes of the retroperitoneum. Although the
     hematoma within the native aorta appears smaller, the retroperitoneal hematoma
     appears larger. There is no active extravasation, foci of gas, or convincing
     rim enhancement to suggest abscess formation. The collection measures 3 x 10cm
     in largest cross section diameter, at the level of the proximal anastomosis.
     The adrenals and right kidney are normal. The left kidney demonstrates two
     rounded low attenuation foci consistent with parapelvic cysts.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The unopacified pelvic bowel loops are normal in
                                                                 (Over)

     appearance. The bladder is decompressed. The prostate contains calcifications
     but is otherwise unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There is marked degeneration of the thoraco-lumbar spine, with
     rotoscoliosis of the lumbar spine, osteophyte formation and vacuum
     degeneration. There is a densely sclerotic focus in the L2 vertebral body,
     extending into the right pedicle. This is described on the [**2573-1-8**] lumbar
     spine MRI and is consistent with a benign focus of ossification.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS: S/P AAA repair, with hematoma anterior to the mid abdominal
     aorta. Extensive pleural calcifications. Lumbar degeneration.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of PE.
     2) Moderate right pleural effusion; small left pleural effusion; pleural
     calcifications consistent with asbestos exposure.
     3) Small focus of groundglass attenuation in the right upper lobe. This is non
     specific, and may represent prior infection/inflammation or scarring.
     Recommend clinical correlation.
     3) Soft tissue attenuation consistent with hematoma anterior to the AAA
     repair. No contrast extravasation seen currently.
     4) Small pancreatic cysts and left renal cysts.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: AAA repair. Acute onset shortness of breath and tachycardia.
     Metabolic acidosis. 
     
     TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced abdominal and pelvic CT was followed by contrast
     enhanced chest, abdomen and pelvis. 150cc of Optiray were administered for
     indication of rapid bolus CTA. Multi planar reformations were created.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2574-9-9**] abdominal and pelvic CT.
     
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar
     lymphadenopathy. The thoracic vessels are normal in contour and caliber. The
     pulmonary vessels are well opacified without evidence of emboli. There is a
     small to moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with associated compressive
     atelectasis of the dependent portion of the right lobe. Innumerable pleural
     based and diaphragmatic plaque calcifications are noted, consistent with
     history of asbestos exposure. On lung windows, there is a 3cm focus of
     reticular groundglass attenuation adjacent to the anterior pleura of the right
     upper lobe. This is non specific, but may represent parenchymal lung changes
     of asbestosis. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base and a minute
     pleural effusion. There is a large hiatal hernia.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver and spleen are normal in
     appearance. The gallbladder is distended, with the distal tip interposed
     between the inferior edge of the liver and the right antero-lateral abdominal
     wall. There is no evidence of obvious cholecystitis by CT criteria, although
     ultrasound would be more sensitive. There are three low attenuation foci in
     the pancreas, one in the tail and two in the head, measuring approximately 1cm
     each. Note that no calcifications were noted within the pancreas on unenhanced
     exam. There has been interval repair of the AAA. The stent extends from the
     infra-renal aorta to the iliac bifurcation. There is a heterogeneous
     collection anterior to the aorta, consistent with hematoma which
     interdigitates into the fat planes of the retroperitoneum. Although the
     hematoma within the native aorta appears smaller, the retroperitoneal hematoma
     appears larger. There is no active extravasation, foci of gas, or convincing
     rim enhancement to suggest abscess formation. The collection measures 3 x 10cm
     in largest cross section diameter, at the level of the proximal anastomosis.
     The adrenals and right kidney are normal. The left kidney demonstrates two
     rounded low attenuation foci consistent with parapelvic cysts.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The unopacified pelvic bowel loops are normal in
                                                                 (Over)

     appearance. The bladder is decompressed. The prostate contains calcifications
     but is otherwise unremarkable.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There is marked degeneration of the thoraco-lumbar spine, with
     rotoscoliosis of the lumbar spine, osteophyte formation and vacuum
     degeneration. There is a densely sclerotic focus in the L2 vertebral body,
     extending into the right pedicle. This is described on the [**2573-1-8**] lumbar
     spine MRI and is consistent with a benign focus of ossification.
     
     RECONSTRUCTIONS: S/P AAA repair, with hematoma anterior to the mid abdominal
     aorta. Extensive pleural calcifications. Lumbar degeneration.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of PE.
     2) Moderate right pleural effusion; small left pleural effusion; pleural
     calcifications consistent with asbestos exposure.
     3) Small focus of groundglass attenuation in the right upper lobe. This is non
     specific, and may represent prior infection/inflammation or scarring.
     Recommend clinical correlation.
     3) Soft tissue attenuation consistent with hematoma anterior to the AAA
     repair. No contrast extravasation seen currently.
     4) Small pancreatic cysts and left renal cysts.

     FINDINGS: Grey scale, color, and Doppler sonographic evaluation was performed
     of bilateral subclavian, internal jugular, and cephalic veins.  Noted within
     the left jugular vein distally is an eccentric filling defect without flow,
     compatible with thrombus in this location that is felt to be chronic.  The
     remainder of the venous structures demonstrate normal flow, without evidence
     for thrombus.
     
     IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within the left jugular vein.
