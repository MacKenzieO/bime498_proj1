Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**] 
Chief Complaint:
SOB
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. woman with unclear PMH, notable for 
transfusion-dependent anemia and HTN noted two weeks of 
increasing non-productive cough and accompanying shortness of 
breath.  Patient says that the cough would come on for 2-3 days, 
then resolve for 2-3 days, then return.  The SOB was only 
associated with the cough and pt says on days when she didn't 
have her cough she wasn't SOB.  Denies any sniffling, runny 
nose, or objective fevers.  She does say she has had some 
mild-moderate diaphoresis x 2 weeks, at first only with the 
cough and now every night.  About 1 week ago she began to 
experience fecal incontinence with the cough, which she says is 
new for her.  Denies any past hx of urinary or fecal 
incontinence.  Also reports  a burning sensation while urinating 
and while defecating, which is also new.  No 
hematuria/melana/BRBPR. + abdominal pain localized to ""a hard 
spot"" in her lower R quadrant.  Denies nausea or vomiting.   
Patient became concerned about her continuing SOB and called an 
ambulance.  She was taken to [**Hospital 1863**] hospital where she was found 
to be hyperkalemia and to have a UTI.  She was treated with 
kayexalate and levaquin and transferred to [**Hospital1 83**].

Of note, patient is an extremely poor historian who knows few 
details about her medical history, the medications she's on, and 
gave me multiple timelines and conflicting stories about her 
symptoms.  Her confusion is relatively subtle but became very 
apparent during our interview.

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unremarkable.  Slight bulge
     of aortic contour possibly represents tortuous aorta vs. aneurysmal
     dilations.  Pulmonary vascularity appears within normal limits. No focal
     consolidations are seen within the lungs. Rounded calcific densities seen in
     the right lower lung likely represents granulomas. There is mild loss of
     height in the mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
