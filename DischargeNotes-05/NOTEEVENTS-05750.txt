Admission Date:  [**2516-1-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2516-1-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2453-4-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company **]

Prior discharge summary ends dictation on events through
[**2516-1-13**].  Notable events since that discharge summary
include the following:

The patient's thrombocytopenia continued to improve off
heparin products.  The patient's final level at the time of
this dictation was a platelet count of 503.  The patient's
hematocrit had decreased somewhat from 28 to 24.7 and should
be followed in her extended care facility stay.  The patient
was noted to have some burning on urination on the [**12-16**].  A urinalysis was noted to have 38 white blood
cells and less then 1 epithelial cell with many bacteria.
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po b.i.d. to
treat a presumed urinary tract infection.  The patient did
spike a temperature on the evening of [**2516-1-14**] as well.  This
was largely thought to be due to her severe clot burden,
however, blood cultures were drawn as well as a urine
culture, which were no growth to date.  The patient was
started on Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s., which was increased
subsequently to 10 mg q.h.s. given slow increase in the
patient's INR, however, dose again was decreased to 5 mg po
q.h.s. when Ciprofloxacin was started due to interaction of
Warfarin with floxacin drugs.  It is recommended that the
patient's hematocrit and INR be checked every day until
therapeutic level of Coumadin can be established and dose
regulated and also to watch for any signs or symtpoms of
bleeding since the patient had severe bleeding in the
Intensive Care Unit during prior days of this
hospitalization.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po b.i.d. to be
taken through [**2516-1-18**].  Metoprolol 12.5 mg po
b.i.d., sliding scale regular insulin, Zolpidem 5 mg po
q.h.s. prn, Folic acid 2 mg po q day, Salmeterol inhaler two
puffs b.i.d., Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 hours prn,
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s.  The patient
was to have a pneumatic boot to her right lower extremity
when not ambulating.  Physical therapy and intensive
ambulation encouraged at rehab.

As noted previously the patient's code status has been
changed to DNR/DNI.  The following outpatient appointments
have been made for the patient and she should be transported
from rehab to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Clinical Center at [**Hospital1 74**] for both appointments.  First
appointment is for chest CAT scan on [**2516-1-31**] at
10:00 a.m.  This will take place at the 4th Floor of the
[**Hospital Ward Name **] Clinical Center.  The patient is to have no food or
drink three hours prior to that study and is best to be NPO
after midnight the prior evening.  The second follow up
appointment is with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7069**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of oncology on
[**2515-2-6**] at 10:00 a.m.  That will take place on the
7th Flor of the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Clinical Center.  The patient has a
previously scheduled appointment with her primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**2516-2-22**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary embolus.
2.  Left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
3.  Resolving thrombocytopenia possibly due to Gemcitabine or
heparin therapy.
4.  Diabetes type 2.
5.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
6.  Asthma.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Stage four nonsmall cell lung cancer.

The patient is being discharged to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Street Address 7070**] in [**Location (un) 210**].
