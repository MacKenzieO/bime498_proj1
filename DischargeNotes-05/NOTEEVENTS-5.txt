.
ECHO [**2648-12-25**]: 
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is moderately to severely 
depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the inferior 
and infero-lateral walls. No masses or thrombi are seen in the 
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There 
is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
CATH [**2648-12-27**]:  
1. Limited selective coronary angiography demonstrated single 
vein  
graft disease. The SVG-RCA demonstrated no angiographically 
apparent,  
flow-limiting disease including the native vessel distal to the  

touchdown which was involved with the STEMI. The SVG-diagonal 
was  
without angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease. The 
SVG-LAD  
had an ostial 70% lesion.  
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension 
with  
blood pressure of 182/93 mmHg.  
3. Successful placement of 3.0 x 18 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent 
in  
the ostial SVG-LAD. Final angiography demonstrated no residual 
stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal 
flow (See PTCA Comments).  
.  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  
1. Single vein graft stenosis.  
2. Central hypertension.  
3. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in SVG-LAD.  
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
82yo M w/ STEMI now s/p cath with DES to R RCA/PDA. Plan is to 
go back to cath for stent to LAD today.  
.  
# ISCHEMIA: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5636**] already had elevated cardiac enzymes on 
presentation to the CCU, with inferior and lateral ST elevations 
on his EKG. On catheterization, it was found that one of his 
grafts, the SVG -> distal RCA, had 100% occlusion at distal 
anastomosis involving both PDA and PL branch bifurcation. A DES 
was placed in the r-PDA and the r-PL had a balloon angioplasty, 
with restoration of TIMI 3 flow. He was on intregrillin for 18 
hours post-cath. Post-cath, he had residual ST elevations in the 
inferior and lateral leads and persistent chest pain, though it 
was much improved from the pain he had on admission. His cardiac 
enzymes peaked on [**2648-12-24**], with CK of 5712, CKMB >500, MBI 8.5, 
and troponins of >25. He was initially on a nitro gtt, but that 
was weaned off as his blood pressure was low. He had no change 
in his pain off the nitro gtt. His chest pain resolved on its 
own on HD #[**Street Address 5637**] elevations still persisted. He was 
started on ASA, plavix, bblocker, ACE-i, and a statin. Based on 
the results of his first catheterization, it was decided to 
repeat a catheterization on [**2648-12-27**] and to stent his LAD graft 
(which had a 70% ostial stenosis). He received mucomyst and 
bicarb prior to his second catheterization for his chronic renal 
insufficiency (Cr was 2.2). He tolerated the second 
catheterization well. There were no groin complications from 
either cath and he was able to be discharged home, with close 
follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5638**]. 
.  
# PUMP: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5636**] had an ECHO on [**2648-12-25**] which showed his EF to be 
30%, down from LVEF of >55% in 4/05 (on an ECHO from his PCP's 
office). The ECHO showed that he has akinetic inferior and 
inferolateral walls and global LV and RV hypokinesis. 
Immediately after his MI, he had a lot of ectopy, including 
multiple runs of NSVT (as long 20 beats) and AIVR. However, the 
ectopy improved over time and he remained mostly in NSR 
throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. A discussion 
about an AICD was deferred as his ectopy improved and it was 
felt that his EF may improve with resolution of his acute event. 
He received IVF post-catheterization and tolerated it well, 
without any evidence of volume overload. His BUN and Cr actually 
rose slightly, to 40/2.2, which may have been prerenal as he was 
not taking in good PO's. He was again given post-cath hydration 
after his second catheterization and his Cr improved to 2.0. He 
was started on an ACE-inhibitor and bblocker for his ACS as well 
as his heart failure and tolerated them both well, without any 
side effects. They were changed to once-daily dosing prior to 
discharge. 
.  
# RHYTHM: He was monitored on telemetry throughout his entire 
hospital course. Immediately after his first catheterization 
(which was peri-MI), he had a significant amount of ectopy, with 
up to 20 beats of VT and multiple episodes of AIVR, but the 
ectopy improved over time. He remained in NSR for the remainder 
of his hospital course.   
.  
# DELIRIUM: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5639**] at night. He was given zydis SL, 
ativan and ambien in attempts to help him [**Doctor Last Name 314**], but none 
worked. He was eventually given seroquel 25mg PO QHS which 
helped him [**Doctor Last Name 314**] and prevented him from sundowning. 
.  
# ASTHMA: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5636**] was diagnosed w/ asthma several years ago and 
states that he uses albuterol INH q6 at home. He was continued 
on that regimen here, despite the fact that he had no wheezing 
or shortness of breath. He was able to maintain stable O2 sats 
on RA at rest and while ambulating prior to discharge. 
.  
# CRI: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5636**] has chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline 
Cr of 1.8 to 2.2. His Cr on admission was 1.9 and remained 
within his normal range throughout his hospital stay. He was 
given post-cath hydration after both procedures as well as 
mucomyst and IVF with bicarb prior to his second 
catheterization. His Cr on discharge was 2.0. 
.  
# BLOOD in STOOL: He was seen to have stool streaked w/ blood on 
HD #1. His Hct was monitored and remained stable despite 
receiving IVF. It was felt that the blood-streaked stools were 
likely due to hemorrhoids in the setting of anti-platelet 
therapy. He had no further episodes throughout his stay. 
.  
# FEN: He was given a cardiac, heart healthy diet. He received 
IVF after both catheterizations, as well as IVF with bicarb 
prior to his 2nd procedure. His electrolytes were checked daily 
and were repleted prn to keep K >4 and Mg >2.

     COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT of one day previous.  No more remote

     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were
     performed, with diffusion-weighted images.  Post-contrast T1 axial and coronal
     images were obtained.
     
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is elevated T2 and FLAIR
     signal within the right cerebellum and encephalomalacia, consistent with an
     old infarction. There is elevated T2 and FLAIR signal within the right
     parietal lobe as well, involving cortical and white matter tissue. There is
     minimally restricted diffusion at this locale.  There is a small somewhat ill-
     defined area of gadolinium enhancement within the right parietal white matter
     at the medial aspect of increased T2 and FLAIR signal. These findings in sum
     suggest subacute infarction within the right parietal lobe, though underlying

     vertebral to form the basilar artery.  Flow is depicted within the right
     vertebral artery at approximately the C2 level.  Diminished signal more
     distally may represent slow flow versus occlusion, as 3D time-of-flight
     imaging can be insensitive to slow flow.  Otherwise, the major tributaries of

     DECISION:   
      
     INTERPRETATION: 
     Ventilation images obtained with Tc-99m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate central 
     areas of aerosol clumping consistent with underlying COPD. 
      
     Perfusion images in the same 8 views show tracer distribution similar to 
     ventilation images.  No mismatches identified. 
      
     Chest x-ray shows no consolidation. 
      
     The above findings are consistent with a low probability of pulmonary embolism.

     CMR Technical Information:
     1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
     obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
     2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
     ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, contiguous short axis
     orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular
     outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. Flow: Phase-contrast
     cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta (axial plane) and main
     pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
     3) Viability/Fibrosis: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
     segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition. Short-axis, four chamber and
     two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
     total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (23 ml Magnevist  solution)
     with spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.

     (Cont)
     Findings:
     Structure and Function
     There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium appeared to have
     homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
      The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There were no pericardial or
     pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries
     were identified in their customary positions.  Image quality was inadequate to
     accurately assess bypass graft patency.  There was diffuse atheroma noted in
     the aorta.  The diameters of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta
     were normal.  The diameter of the ascending aorta was mildly dilated. The main
     pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
     dilated.   The coronary sinus diameter was normal.
     The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-
     diastolic volume index was mildly dilated.  The calculated left ventricular
     ejection fraction was moderately depressed at 44% with abnormal regional
     function.  Regional wall motion abnormalities included akinesis of the
     inferior and inferolateral LV walls. The left ventricular mass index was
     normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The
     calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was mildly depressed at 46%,
     with mild global hypokinesis.
     The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.
     The pericardial thickness was normal.
     Quantitative Flow
     There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
     significant aortic regurgitation.  The calculated mitral valve regurgitant
     fraction was consistent with no significant mitral regurgitation.   The
     resultant effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 44%. The right
     ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant
     pulmonic or tricuspid regurgitation.
     
     Viability
      The inferior and inferolateral walls showed complete, transmural delayed
     hyperenhancement, consistent with the presence of prior myocardial
     scarring/infarction.  The hyperenhanced area was calculated to weigh
     approximately 30 grams.  This represents 17% of the LV myocardial mass, which
     corresponds to a moderate sized infarction. Given the transmural
     hyperenhancement in these walls, there is a very low likelihood of functional
     recovery after revascularization of these segments (no viability).
     
     Impression:
     1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
     ventricular systolic function.  The LVEF was moderately depressed at 44%. MR
     evidence of prior inferior and infero-lateral myocardial scarring/infarction,
     without viability. The infarct size was moderate at 17% of the total LV mass.
     2. Normal right ventricular cavity size. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 46%.
                                                                 (Over)

     artery diameter was normal.

     CMR Technical Information:
     1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
     obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
     2) Function: Breath-hold cine SSFP images were acquired in the left
     ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis, contiguous short axis
     orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the left ventricular
     outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations. Flow: Phase-contrast
     cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta (axial plane) and main
     pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
     3) Viability/Fibrosis: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
     segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition. Short-axis, four chamber and
     two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
     total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (23 ml Magnevist  solution)
     with spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     (Cont)
     Findings:
     Structure and Function
     There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium appeared to have
     homogenous signal intensity without evidence of myocardial fatty infiltration.
      The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There were no pericardial or
     pleural effusions. The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries
     were identified in their customary positions.  Image quality was inadequate to
     accurately assess bypass graft patency.  There was diffuse atheroma noted in
     the aorta.  The diameters of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta
     were normal.  The diameter of the ascending aorta was mildly dilated. The main
     pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
     dilated.   The coronary sinus diameter was normal.
     The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.  The end-
     diastolic volume index was mildly dilated.  The calculated left ventricular
     ejection fraction was moderately depressed at 44% with abnormal regional
     function.  Regional wall motion abnormalities included akinesis of the
     inferior and inferolateral LV walls. The left ventricular mass index was
     normal.  The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The
     calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was mildly depressed at 46%,
     with mild global hypokinesis.
     The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.
     The pericardial thickness was normal.
     Quantitative Flow
     There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
     significant aortic regurgitation.  The calculated mitral valve regurgitant
     fraction was consistent with no significant mitral regurgitation.   The
     resultant effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 44%. The right
     ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant
     pulmonic or tricuspid regurgitation.
     
     Viability
      The inferior and inferolateral walls showed complete, transmural delayed
     hyperenhancement, consistent with the presence of prior myocardial
     scarring/infarction.  The hyperenhanced area was calculated to weigh
     approximately 30 grams.  This represents 17% of the LV myocardial mass, which
     corresponds to a moderate sized infarction. Given the transmural
     hyperenhancement in these walls, there is a very low likelihood of functional
     recovery after revascularization of these segments (no viability).
     
     Impression:
     1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
     ventricular systolic function.  The LVEF was moderately depressed at 44%. MR
     evidence of prior inferior and infero-lateral myocardial scarring/infarction,
     without viability. The infarct size was moderate at 17% of the total LV mass.
     2. Normal right ventricular cavity size. The RVEF was mildly depressed at 46%.
                                                                 (Over)

     3. No significant aortic, mitral, pulmonic or tricuspid regurgitation
     4. The diameters of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta were normal.
      The diameter of the ascending aorta was mildly dilated.  The main pulmonary
     artery diameter was normal.
     5. Mild left atrial enlargement
     6. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous coronary
     arteries.  Image quality was inadequate to accurately assess bypass graft
     patency.
