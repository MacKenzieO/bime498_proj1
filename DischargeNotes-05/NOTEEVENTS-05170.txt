Service:  [**Company **]


ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Seizures - The patient did not have any
further seizures.  She was maintained on Keppra and Dilantin
and was therapeutic on Dilantin.  Her Dilantin level was
checked approximately three days prior to discharge.

Electrolyte imbalances - The patient was continued on
Florinef and, while there was some fluctuation in her sodium
and potassium, they were within a stable range not requiring
any other treatment.

Hypertension - The patient's hypertension remained stable.
She was continued on Nifedipine and Lopressor.  The ace
inhibitor was held due to renal insufficiency and
hyperkalemia.

Aspiration pneumonia - Approximately one week prior to
discharge, the patient developed hypoxia and tachypnea.
Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia likely due to
aspiration.  The patient was started on Levaquin and Flagyl
and had gradual improvement over the week.  On discharge, she
did not require any supplemental oxygen and was breathing
comfortably.  There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or
congestive heart failure.

Alcohol abuse - The patient was seen by psychiatry and social
work with a plan to discharge her to detoxification facility.

Diabetes mellitus - The patient was maintained on insulin,
Glargine and sliding scale regular insulin with relatively
well controlled blood glucose.  There was an increase in her
Lantus, but the patient did not tolerate this becoming
hypoglycemic.

Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's creatinine was
stable between 1.3 and 1.7.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to a
detoxification facility by Section 35.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Seizure history.  Worsening oxygen requirement to
     development of fever.  
     
     Compared to [**2594-3-15**].
     
     The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  There is slight
     upper zone vascular redistribution with perihilar haziness.  Bibasilar areas
     of increased opacity are again demonstrated, particularly in the retrocardiac
     regions.  There is also a new hazy area of increased opacity in the right
     upper lobe.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are present and are new in the
     interval.
     
     On the lateral view, note is made of a severe compression deformity in the
     upper thoracic spine. This was present on an older chest x-ray of [**2594-1-26**], as well.
     
     When comparison is made to the older study of [**1-15**], the cardiac
     silhouette has increased in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Interval development of CHF with associated bilateral small pleural
     effusions. There is probably a component of underlying aspiration pneumonia,
     as basilar consolidative changes preceded the congestive heart failure
     findings.

     The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is upper zone vascular
     redistribution.  There are multifocal areas of consolidation present in the
     right upper lobe and both lower lobes, the latter mostly in the retrocardiac
     regions.  There is also perihilar haziness present and a small right pleural
     effusion.  Previously noted small left pleural effusion is no longer
     visualized.  As compared to the recent study, there has been slight worsening
     of consolidation in the right upper lobe.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Multifocal consolidation in the right upper and both lower lobe regions.
     As noted previously, this may be due to a multifocal pneumonia from
     aspiration.
     2)  Mild congestive heart failure.

     well.
     
     CTA OF THE CHEST:  The opacified pulmonary arterial tree does not demonstrate
     any filling defects indicative of pulmonary embolus to the level of the
     subsegmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  The heart and great vessels are
     normal in appearance.  There is no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar,
     or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Note is made of a small calcified right apical
     granuloma.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST:   The liver demonstrates diffuse low
     attenuation, compatible with fatty infiltration.  There is a tiny calcific
     density within the right lobe of the liver which is consistent with a small
     granuloma.  The liver is otherwise unremarkable, without evidence of intra or
     extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  The portal vein is patent.  The gallbladder,
     spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are grossly normal.  The stomach and
     visualized bowel loops are unremarkable.  The pancreas is markedly atrophic
     and calcified with a prominent duct, consistent with the patient's history of
     alcoholic pancreatitis.  No peripancreatic inflammatory changes or fluid
     collections are identified.  
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters and
     pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable.  There is a large calcified uterine
     fibroid measuring approximately 5 cm.  No free fluid is present within the
     pelvis.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.
     
                                                                 (Over)

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient dehydrated, needs PICC placement for precardiac
     catheterization, rehydration.
     
     TECHNIQUE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1377**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 369**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 179**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**], the Attending Radiologist, being present and
     supervising. The left upper arm was prepped and drapped in a sterile fashion.
     Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for
     localization of a suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
     compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2- mm of 1% Lidocaine, the left
     brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge
     needle.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained, documentating patent
     vein before and after establishing an access. An 0.018 guide wire was advanced
     under fluroscopy into the superior vena cava.
     Based on the marker on the guide wire, it was determined that a length of 43-
     cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a
     4 french introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
     cava.  The shaeth was then removed.  The cathether was flushed.  The line is
     ready for use.
     
     FINDINGS: An AP view of the chest demonstrated the tip to be in the superior
     vena cava just above the atrium.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a left brachial vein 43-cm 4 french single
     lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

Pt admitted to EW today with changes in MS. Pt found today by her neighbor to have swollen lip and depressed mental status and neighbor thought she may have had a seizure. Arrival to EW temp was 101, BP 213/144 with HR 130's. Pt is thought to be non-compliant with her meds. Her dilantin level was 0. She was given loading dose of dilantin 1gm IV. Pt was enterred into the sepsis protocol when her lactate level came bback 5.0. A central line was placed and she was given a total of 7 liters NS in EW for CVP in the 0-2 range. She had elevated glucose in the 300's with negative acetone and her ABG was acidotic. Up here in MICU she was started on insulin drip to keep blood glucose 100-120. Source of sepsis still unclear. She has head CT to rule out abnormalities. Also abdominal US was done. She is to have abdominal CT done this evening after she gets barocat (pt is having nausea and vomiting so team needs to get NGT placed first) and mucomist PO.

MICU NPN Review of Systems:
Neuro: Pt awake and alert, oriented times three but c/o diffuse body aches and pains. Pt saying she has tremendous HA, blurry vision, feels shaky and requesting her ativan for withdrawal symptoms. CIWA scale was 16 at about 7PM so pt given 2mg IV ativan with good effe4ct. She also had c/o nausea and vomited when I attempted to give her barocat fot the CT of the abdomen ordered for this eve. The ativan helped this also. She is strong, MAE PEARL.

CV: BP 160-170/70-90. HR 90's-120's depending on level of agitation/anxiety. CVP was [**3-18**] upon arrival to floor and pt had received 7 liters NS in EW. IVF switched to D5w with 150meq bicarb at 150cc/hr due to pt being acidotic with relatively low serum bicarb. SVO2 monitor hooked up to pt and reading in the 72-76 range. She is being ruled out by enzymes and next draw is at 10PM along with the chem 7 and CBC needed for the sepsis protocol labs. Magnesium repleted as ordered.

Resp: Pt is on 2L N/C with good sats. Lungs are clear. RR 20, non-labored.

Endo: Pt is on insulin drip and requires Q1hr fingersticks to keep sugars at goal 90-110. Currently drip is at 2u/hr with glucose 112.

GI/Heme: Pt has had NGT inserted for barocat and is scheduled for abdominal CT tonight. Pt is to get mucomist doses times four for renal protection. She had c/o nausea and vomited once for me after getting PO meds and one cup of barocat. MD has changed most of her meds to IV but the rest can be given PO once CT is done. She had large amt diarrhea stool in EW and has +Bowel sounds. Will be NPO for now until source of infection determined.

GU: UO is excellent via foley and urine is clear straw colored.

Social: I was not able to get to the phone to update her husband when he called and when I tried to call him he was not there. I will try again later to give him an update on his wifes condition.

ID: Still febrile to 101 rectal upon arrival to MICU. Pt is on IV vanco/ceftaz/flagyl/levo.

Plan: Pt has been scheduled for cardiac echo tomorrow to look for possible vegitation on her valve.. Continue antibiotics/fluids/meds as ordered. Follow CIWA scale Q2-4hrs and treat with ativan 1-4mg as needed for CIWA > 10.

     IV CONTRAST:  Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used for the patient's
     debility.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There are very small bilateral pleural effusions
     seen at the lung bases, with associated minor atelectasis.  There is diffuse
     fatty infiltration of the liver, but no liver masses or biliary ductal
     dilatation.  Compared to previous exam, the gallblader is noted to be
     distended and there is wall edema and/or pericholecystic fluid. No gallstones
     are seen.  The pancreas is atrophied with multiple calcifications and an
     irregular enlarged pancreatic duct, consistent with the patient's known
     history of chronic pancreatitis.  The spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands,
     stomach, and bowel loops are normal.  The appendix is identified and normal.
     There mild ascites and diffuse edema of the mesentery.  Contrast reaches the
     rectum and there is no evidence of obstruction.  No free air.  No focal fluid
     collections are seen.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again noted is a large calcified fibroid in the
     uterus, which is otherwise unremarkable and unchanged.  Pelvic bowel loops are
     normal.  The bladder and distal  ureters are unremarkable.  A Foley balloon
     catheter tip is in the bladder.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Distended gallbladder with wall edema and/or adjacent pericholecystic
     fluid.
     
     2) Mild ascites and edema of the mesentery.  No focal fluid collections.
     
     3) Very small bilateral pleural effusions.
                                                                 (Over)
