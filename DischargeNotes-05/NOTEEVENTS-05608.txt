Admission Date:  [**3124-1-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**3124-2-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**3043-12-5**]       Sex:  M

Service: NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In summary, this is an
80-year-old man with past medical history significant for
lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, and COPD, who presented with intractable
emesis, slurred speech, and later obtundation.  He was
initially brought to [**Hospital3 **], where pneumonia was
diagnosed.  He was intubated for hypoxia and
unresponsiveness, and then was sent to [**Hospital1 797**] for further management.

Here at [**Hospital3 **], his head CT showed a left cerebellar
infarct.  His INR was therapeutic on arrival at [**Location (un) 579**],
however, when he presented here, his INR was actually 5.2.  A
MRI was done here at [**Hospital1 **], which confirmed
an infarction in the left superior cerebellar territory.  He
was extubated on [**3124-1-24**], and has done well since.
He was transferred to the floor from the ICU on [**3124-1-26**].  He was still on a face mask O2.  He denied any
shortness of breath, and says that he felt well.  In
discussion with his wife and the patient as per his wishes,
he did not want to be re-intubated for respiratory failure.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lymphoma.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. COPD.
4. Hypertension.
5. Prostate cancer.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.
2. Digoxin.
3. Pepcid.
4. Hydralazine prn.
5. Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
6. Coumadin for a goal INR between [**3-5**].
7. Sliding scale insulin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked one pack per day.  He has no
alcohol use.  He lives with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant only for cardiac disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the floor, he was
afebrile at 97.2, blood pressure is 166/70, heart rate was
78, respiratory rate was 18, and he was satting 99% on a 40%
face mask.  He was in no acute distress.  He appeared
comfortable.  HEENT examination:  His oropharynx was clear.
Mucous membranes were moist.  His lungs had coarse bilateral
breath sounds with some end expiratory wheezes at the bases.
His heart was irregular with normal S1, S2 with no murmurs.
His abdomen was soft, and extremities were warm.
Neurologically, he was able to follow one step commands.  He
showed two fingers.  He was able to lift up both legs.  He
was able to lift up both arms.  He can answer simple
questions appropriately.  He was fluent, but no dysarthria
that was obvious.  Cranial nerves:  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  He
was able to cross the midline with gaze.  His fundi were
normal.  He had a right facial droop.  His tongue protruded
to the midline without vesiculations.  On motor examination,
he had normal bulk and tone throughout.  He moved his left
arm against gravity.  Weaker on the right upper extremity,
however, he was able to lift it against gravity.  He had less
spontaneous overall movement on the right arm.  His legs:  He
was able to lift both of them equally and hold them up.  He
had very slight weakness on the right leg compared to the
left leg throughout.  His reflexes were 1+ in the upper
extremities.  They seem to be decreased on the right side.
He has an upgoing toe on the right side.  Sensation:  He
withdrew to pain.  It was intact to light touch and
temperature, however, the patient not very cooperative with
this examination.  Unable to really test coordination again
due to cooperativity, had not been able to test his walk.

LABORATORIES:  On presentation to the floor, his laboratories
were a white count of 7.3, platelets of 204, hematocrit 37.4.
His INR was therapeutic, at one point it was complicated with
an INR of 5.2 likely secondary to levofloxacin which was
started for his pneumonia.  Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s. was held
and then his INR drifted down to normal levels.

His levofloxacin after two days was switched to ceftriaxone
and he was also started on clindamycin IV.  He completed 10
days total of levofloxacin plus ceftriaxone and nine days of
clindamycin IV, and his chest x-ray was markedly improved.

His hospital course was complicated only by the pneumonia.
He was very slow to come back appear more alert and oriented,
and after seven days, he was on nasogastric tube feeds, and
eventually a PEG tube was placed on [**3124-2-6**].  He was
started on PEG tube feeds on [**2-7**] a.m. and he has
tolerated those well without complications.

In summary, this is an 80-year-old man with history of
lymphoma, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, who presented with
emesis, slurred speech, and right hemiparesis, who was found
to have a left superior cerebellar artery infarction with
residual deficits.  He has mild ataxia and mild hemiparesis
on the right side with a right facial droop.  He was
evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy team
here, who deemed that he needed acute rehab services.

After discussion with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent out to rehab on
[**3124-2-8**].

     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT followed by a CT angiogram of the circle of
     [**Location (un) 405**] with coronal and sagittally reformatted images.
     
     INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray due to fast bolus technique.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT [**3124-1-22**] at 11:48AM.
     
     FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior non-contrast head CT, there has been no
     change in the appearance of the brain parenchyma, including a moderate to
     large sized area of low density within the left cerebellar hemisphere, perhaps
     involving the pons as well.  The size of the ventricles is unchanged.
     Hypodensities in the periventricular white matter areas bilaterally are also
     unchanged.  There is no hydrocephalus, but the forth ventricle is mild to
     moderately narrowed.
     
     CT angiogram of the circle of [**Location (un) 405**] demonstrates complete opacification of
     the vertebral arteries, the basilar artery, and the major branches of the
     internal carotid artery.  There is no evidence of large aneurysm.
     
     Trace fluid is seen within the sphenoid sinuses, and there is opacification of
     the ethmoid sinuses.  There is a minimal amount of mucosal thickening within
     the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.  An ET tube and a nasogastric tube are
     noted.

Respiratory Care:
Pt. received on PS settings per flowsheet.  ABG's showed marginal oxygenation with partially compensated respiratory acidosis>>team wanted to trial Pt. on SIMV, to try to fully compensate the acidosis, and because Pt. triggering the apnea alarm (at 20-25 seconds).  Unclear if apnea trigger is due to actual apnea (would expect ABG to show either a fully compensated respiratory acidosis or a slight respiratory alkalosis), or due to ""[**Male First Name (un) **]-[**Last Name (un) 648**] manuever"" post forced coughing.  Repeat ABG's on rate of 16 X 500cc showed no change.  Because Pt. required increased propofol to accomodate SIMV, team decided to place back on PS settings.  Repeat ABG's on PS, with increased FIO2, showed more fully compensated respiratory acidosis, with a much improved oxygenation.  Increased apnea delay to 30 seconds with good effect.  Started Pt. on combivent for pronounced wheezes, especially post SXN.  SXN frequently for small to moderate, thick, pale, yellow.  Pt. responded well to bronchodilators.  RSBI done this a.m. was 35!  Per team, plan to give SBT, and evaluate for extubation. Will require monitor for airway patency post extubation.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with question of stenosis at vertebral origin,
     for further evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: 2D and 3D time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels were aquired.
     
     FINDINGS: The examination is limited secondary to motion. The left internal
     carotid artery demonstrates approximately 60% stenosis at the origin.  The
     right internal carotid artery demonstrates mild irregularity of the flow
     signal indicating mild atherosclerotic disease.  Both vertebral arteries in
     the neck demonstrate normal flow signal.
     
     IMPRESSION: Approximately 60% stenosis at the origin of the left internal
     carotid artery.  Normal flow signal in the vertebral arteries in the neck.  It
     should be noted that on the current study the vertebral artery origins are not
     evaluated.  For better evaluation of the vertebral artery origins, if
     clinically indicated gadolinium enhanced MRA of the neck is recommended.
