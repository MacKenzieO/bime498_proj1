                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI OF THE BRAIN AND ORBITS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST ON [**3-29**]
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup leukemia.  Left monocular blindness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images, axial T2-
     weighted, susceptibility, FLAIR and diffusion-weighted images and coronal STIR
     images were obtained.  Thin section and fat saturated images were obtained
     through the orbits.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     Comparison is made to the [**3026-1-12**] study which showed a ventricular catheter
     extending from right frontal burr hole to the level of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 116**].
     The catheter appears to have been removed.
     
     As seen on the intervening study from [**3026-2-19**], there is a multilobulated area
     of T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity along the catheter tract with thin
     peripheral enhancement and surrounding edema.  There is associated
     susceptibility effect consistent with blood breakdown products.  No T1
     hyperintensity is seen on the pre-contrast images.  There is no restricted
     diffusion within the lesions.  These areas have decreased in size slightly.
     The surrounding edema is also slightly improved and there is no longer mass
     effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 116**]. Perhaps these lesions are related to
     hemorrhages along the catheter tract. Obviously leukemic infiltration cannot
     be completely excluded.  No new lesion is seen in the brain parenchyma.
     
     The current orbital images are superior to the last set of orbital images. The
     left optic nerve is shown to be edematous and probably mildly enlarged. There
     is slight enhancement in both optic nerve sheaths, slightly more prominent on
     the right than the left suggesting leptomeningeal or CSF leukemic
     infiltration.  There is some stranding in the orbital fat particularly on the
     right.  Comparison was quite difficult due to artifact on the prior study but
     probably enhancement in the orbital apices has improved slightly.  Relatively
     thick coronal images were obtained through the optic chiasm region and it is
     grossly normal.  There is no diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement.  There is
     minimal right-sided dural enhancement previously likely related to the Ommaya
     reservoir catheter.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1.  There is subtle enhancement in the optic nerve sheaths bilaterally
     suggesting leukemic infiltration.  There is some enhancement in the
     surrounding fat at the orbital apices but no discrete mass.
     2.  There is subtle edema in the left optic nerve consistent with the history
     of optic neuritis.
     3.  There are multilobulated peripherally enhancing masses along the
     ventricular catheter tract in the anterior right frontal white matter.  They
     contain blood breakdown products and may represent resolving hematomas. They
     have decreased in size and there is less surrounding edema.  The mass effect
     on the ventricular system has resolved.  Obviously leukemic involvement of
     this cannot be excluded.

     LUMBAR SPINE MRI SCAN WITH GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT
     
     HISTORY:  Acute lymphocytic leukemia with known CNS disease.  Now with
     peroneal numbness.  Assess for disease involvement.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced lumbar spine
     images.
     
     COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the spine, dated [**3026-1-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no new mass lesion seen either within the thecal sac or in
     the epidural space.  However, as was noted on the prior study, there is
     probable very slight enhancement of the rootlets of the cauda equina, diffuse
     in fashion, without nodularity that would more clearly diagnose leptomeningeal
     involvement by tumor.  As per your telephone conversation, recent spinal fluid
     cytology was negative for malignant cells.  If there is no leptomeningeal
     neoplastic disease, perhaps the slight enhancement of the cauda equina
     reflects arachnoiditis.  There is prominent narrowing and desiccation of the
     L5-S1 disc space.  This finding was also noted on the prior spinal imaging
     study, sited above.  No other areas of spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis.
     Overall, the marrow signal is stable in appearance, as well.
     
     
     CONCLUSION:  Persistent, very slight diffuse enhancement of the rootlets of
     the cauda equina.  In the absence of a positive cytology for malignant cells,
     perhaps the finding represents arachnoiditis.  Other findings as noted above.
     
     COMMENT:  As we discussed extensively by telephone today (this is [**3026-4-5**] at
     9:15 a.m.) the present study does not include the entire pelvis, nor the
     distal sacrum and coccyx.  If these areas need to be examined relative to the
     symptoms [**Doctor First Name 659**] reported, additional imaging studies are required to encompass
     these structures.

Service: 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  At time of transfer to MICU on
[**3026-4-8**], a 52-year-old female with history of refractory
ALL status post MUD now treated on Gleevec status post allo-
SVT with Campath status post recent hyper-CVAD on [**3026-4-1**]. Was initially admitted to BMT on [**4-7**] with febrile
neutropenia. Later in the evening of admission, patient had a
syncopal episode upon arising and struck her head. At that
point, systolic blood pressures were at the 70s and was
mentating well. Patient was transported for head CT where she
became less responsive and was found to be hypotensive with
systolic pressures in the 50s. Patient was transferred to the
ICU for further management of hypotension and presumed septic
shock.

Initial ICU course was notable for 6 liters of normal saline
fluid, and pressor requirements that included Levophed, Neo-
Synephrine, and vasopressin all at maximum levels. She was
intubated for hypoxia secondary to pulmonary edema from fluid
resuscitation. After a very difficult intubation, patient's
husband had requested that the patient be extubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  ALL as outlined above.
2.  Status post breast reduction.
3.  Hypothyroid.
4.  Anxiety.

ALLERGIES:  Cefepime and epinephrine.

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF TRANSFER:  Vancomycin, Flagyl,
aztreonam, Neupogen, fluconazole, acyclovir, Gleevec,
Protonix, and Levoxyl.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature is 100.8, blood pressure is
80/30, pulse is in the 120s, respiratory rate 30. General is
significant for a chronically ill female who is intubated.
Cardiovascular exam: S1, S2 was regular. Pulmonary exam is
significant for expiratory wheezing with evidence also of a
Hickman catheter in the neck. Abdominal exam shows hypoactive
bowel sounds, soft. Extremities have trace edema.

LABORATORIES FROM ADMISSION:  CBC: White count of 0.1 with an
ANC of 10, hematocrit of 19.9 down from 23.3, platelet count
of 35,000.

PT is 14, INR is 1.3, PTT of 29.

Chemistries: 136, 3.3, 111, 16, 70, 1.2, 117. Calcium,
magnesium, phosphorus were 5.9, 1.3, and 1.5.

ABG was 7.29, 37, 94.

Blood cultures grew out gram-positive cocci and gram-negative
rods. C. difficile toxin was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 52-year-old female with history of
refractory ALL now day 12 status post hyper-CVAD admitted
with febrile neutropenia as complicated by presumed septic
shock, is transferred to the ICU.

Septic shock: Patient had evidence of gram-positive cocci and
gram-negative rods in blood. This bacteremia was thought to
be the etiology of her profound hypotension and septic shock.
The source of this bacteremia was unclear, but she did have
tenderness in her right upper quadrant which was concerning
for potential cholangitis. She was maintained on broad-
spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, vancomycin, and
Flagyl. At our suggestions of bone marrow transplant, she is
also started on antifungal coverage as well. She required
aggressive fluid resuscitation that initially led to her
intubation secondary to pulmonary edema. Due to difficult
intubation and after further discussion with the family, the
patient was extubated despite concerns about pulmonary edema.
She was maintained on 3 pressors: Norepinephrine,
vasopressin, and Neo-Synephrine to maintain MAPs greater than
60. She still had minimal urine output. She was also off her
stress-dosed steroids as well.

On the morning, after her transfer to the ICU, multiple
meetings took place between the ICU team and the patient and
her husband. At this time, the patient and family did place
emphasis on not escalating the level of care. They did want
to focus on comfort measures at all times. At this point, the
ICU team had decided to continue with aggressive antibiotics
and pressors, but would not escalate level of care including
further imaging, central venous lines, or surgical consults
for a question of cholangitis.

As the day progressed, patient was noted to have increasing
tachypnea secondary to her fluid requirements. After further
discussion with the family at this point, patient was made
completely comfort measures only. At this point, a Dilaudid
drip was instituted for patient's comfort. Her family were at
the bedside as all pressors were turned off. She expired on
[**4-9**] at 3:45 a.m. Her family was at the bedside and
declined an autopsy. The ICU attending was notified as well
as the BMT attending, who has been involved in the patient's
care throughout the day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia complicated by febrile
    neutropenia.
2.  Presumed septic shock.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Dead.

     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN:
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is an area of cribriform hypodensity along the previous
     Ommaya shunt track.  Multiple punctate foci of increased attenuation are seen
     in the rostrum of the corpus callosum and along the previous shunt track.  The
     appearance is not significantly changed compared to the prior examinations. As
     previously stated, these likely represent hemorrhagic products.  There is no
     subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is no hydrocephalus.  The osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Hypodensity along the site of the prior Ommaya shunt track with evolving
     blood products less apparent compared with previous MRI. No significant new
     abnormalities.  These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 12283**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12029**] on
