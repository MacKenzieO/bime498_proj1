Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F w/ NHL, bleomycin induced lung toxicity, admitted w/ SOB 
in setting of tapering prednisone dose, now w/ hypoxic resp 
failure.  

1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: Differential diagnosis was 
originally exacerbation of bleomycin induced lung injury, 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, 
as well as atypical pneumoniaa. Patient was originally placed on 
steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a BAL was performed, 
which was negative for eosinophils or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan showed 
diffuse alveolar filling and interstitial fibrosis consistent 
with bleomycin toxicity. 
Over the course of several hospital days, patient developed 
several acute episodes of worsening hypoxia, mostly with 
agitation and with movement. A further workup was performed, 
which revealed pneumomediastinum seen on CXR, with subcutaneous 
emphysema and pneumomediastinum on CT with no abdominal 
perforation or pneumothorax. The pneumomediastinum was likely 
secondary to barotrauma, and resolved with serial CXRs. CTA done 
at the time was negative for a PE. 
She was placed on high dose steroids, then switched to a 
prednisone taper, for treatment of bleomycin toxicity. Patient 
also had an antibiotic course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, 
which was stopped once cultures were negative. She was also on 
prophylactic doses of TMP-SMX for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3362**]. An echo was 
performed to rule out a shunt as cause of hypoxia, and was found 
to be negative. A decompression needle was kept at the bedside 
for acute pneumothorax. 
Efforts were made to adjust patient's vent settings and to wean 
her oxygen to minimize bleomycin lung toxicity, but patient was 
unable to tolerate weaning with acute desaturations and episodes 
of hypoxia. 
Patient had a surgical tracheostomy placed, with efforts to wean 
oxygen and perhaps go to rehabilitation. However, she continued 
to have high oxygen requirements, and no improvement in her 
clinical status. The decision was made to withdraw care. 

2) Neutropenic fever. Patient originally had a fever to 105 
after the initial BAL, which was thought to be transient 
bacteremia. Cultures were all negative, and patient was 
originally placed on antibiotics, with blood glucose control and 
steroids. This was then later d/c'd when her clinical status 
improved. She continued to have fevers intermittently, with 
persistently negative cultures. Due to her functional 
neutropenia, she was placed on vancomycin and cefepime. She was 
then taken off her antibiotics, during which time she became 
hypotensive and tachycardic, requiring fluid boluses. She then 
was placed back on antibiotics, improved initially, but then 
continued to have hypotension and tachycardia. At that time, 
patient was made DNR/DNI, and she passed away several hours 
later. 

3) NHL- Patient was on cycle [**6-7**] ABVD (without bleo). There were 
no acute/active issues regarding her lymphoma. Her LDH was 
followed. She was followed by hematology-oncology. 
  
4) Anemia/thrombocytopenia/leukopenia: Her pancyopenia was 
thought to be secondary to recent chemotherapy vs marrow 
suppression from drugs or from her NHL. Her hematocrit was 
maintained above 25 with transfusions. She had no active source 
of bleeding. She was taken off her heparin when she developed 
thrombocytopenia, and a HIT antibody was checked, and was 
negative. She was then placed back on her heparin. She was given 
a course of neupogen as well, and remained on neutropenic 
precautions. 

4) Htn: Her verapamil and HCTZ were held.
  
5) Glucose. Patient was placed on an ISS, and was placed on an 
insulin drip for better glucose control. Her blood sugars 
improved with decrease in steroid dose. 
.
6) F/E/N: Patient received tube feeds. She had an attempted PEG 
tube placement but had decreased oxygen saturations during the 
procedure, and it was aborted. She then had air under the 
diaphragm, and tube feeds were held for several days. Her 
electrolytes were repleted. 
.  
7) Ppx: Heparin sc. PPI since on high-dose steroids  
.  
8) ACCESS: Port a cath, peripheral. Subclavian and arterial line 
placed. The subclavian line was changed to an IJ.
.  
9) CODE: Patient was initially full code. She was then made 
DNR/DNI, and then comfort measures only.  
.
10) Comm: son, [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6963**]  

11) Pain/sedation: Patient was on a fentanyl and versed drip. 
She was made comfortable. 

12) Dispo: Patient expired in the hospital.

Housestaff met with several family members to discuss pt's dismal prognosis and likelihood of necessity for prolonged ventilatory support. Family members need to contact other relatives and wish to continue current level of care at this time. Son, [**Doctor Last Name **], stated that he does ""not want to take away all hope"" from his Mom. He feels that a discussion regarding pt's lack of options should not include her. Sedation had been dc'ed at 1400 and pt. is awake, following commands and nodding appropriately. She denies pain when questioned. Housestaff feels that pt. should be included in the decision making process.

Neuro:  Pt remains on fent and versed, she responds to painful stimuli, she has required boluses of both drugs for coughing (coughing causes her to drop her 02 SATs to the 80s).

Resp:  Remains vented, , trache is clean and dry.  She was changed to PSV from A/C, 20x15, her FI02 needed to be increased to .65 from .6 for a Pa02 of 57.  Suctioned for thick blodd tinged sputum, LS coarse, she drops her SATs to the low 80s with coughing - given boluses of fent and versed with good effect.

pt is sedated; at start of this shift, pt's breathing was somewhat  discoordinate w/ vent; tried decreasing fentanyl and increasing versed, with good results; pt's breath pattern became more regular, lost end expiratory 'push'; pt appeared more comfortable; ABG of 3a showed much better oxygenation;
   suctioned only when pt heard to have secretions d/t pt's very poor reserve, spO2 decreases to mid 80's, and takes extra time to return to low 90's even with brief adm 1.0 FIO2 per vent 'suction' button;
   at 06:00, MV's had settled down into '5s', therefore versed weaned just a very small amount, to 5.5 mg/hr; fentanyl at 75 mcgs/hr, down from 125 mcgs/hr;
   FS's remain w/out need for resuming ins gtt,  FS 95 then 139;

new trach site w/out s/s bleeding; pt repositioned in bed q 3 hrs to prevent pressure sores;
   ngt remains to LIS, raining bilious dark green return;
   urine output very good, pt possibly autodiuresing;

1) possibly may need to consider decreasing FIO2 from 0.65, to increase pt pt's intrinsic resp drive
2) needs PEG yet
3) continue IV Abx as ordered
4) provide emotional support for family
