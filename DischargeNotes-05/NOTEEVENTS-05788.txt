MRI of neck:
Each of the discs of the level screened, C2-C7 is narrowed and 
at 
each level there are bilateral disc/osteophyte complexes. 
Endplate 
degenerative changes are noted, as seen on the plain film from 2 
days 
previously. There is mild relative stenosis of the left C2-3 
foramen. There is moderate C3-4 foraminal stenosis. 
At C4-5, there is some indentation of the thecal sac but no 
clear flattening of the spinal cord. There is mild to moderate 
bilateral foraminal stenosis minimally worse on the left than 
the right. 
At C5-6, there is fairly severe left foraminal stenosis, as seen 
on the plain film. There is mild right foraminal stenosis. 
At C6-7, there is also severe left foraminal stenosis from the 
disc/osteophyte complex. Mild right foraminal stenosis is seen. 
The C7-T1 foramina are well maintained. There is minimal 
anterolisthesis of C7 on T1. 
The spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity and there 
is no spinal cord compression. The craniovertebral junction is 
normal. 
IMPRESSION: There is multilevel moderate to severe spondylosis. 
There is bony stenosis of multiple foramina, particularly the 
left C5-6 and C6-7 foramina. No spinal cord compression is seen. 

 
LEFT SHOULDER MR: There is a moderate-sized joint effusion with 
debris within it. Also there is fluid in the subacromial and 
subdeltoid bursa. There are complete tears of the supraspinatus 
tendon and infraspinatus tendon with retraction of their 
respective muscles. Additionally there is high signal within 
their respective muscles consistent with atrophy. There is also 
high signal within the subscapularis tendon on proton 
density-weighted sequence suggestive of a tear. The teres minor 
tendon is intact. There is a high riding humeral head. There are 
osteophytes on the glenoid and within the AC joint. There is 
thinning of both the humeral head and glenoid cartilage. The 
biceps tendon is torn, and there is retraction of the tendon. 
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Torn supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps 
tendons with atrophy of their associated muscles. 
2. Effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  gastrointestinal bleed - Pt was initially admitted to the 
FICU.  The EGD showed that the bleed was likely gastric in 
origin, as there was fresh blood in the antrum, but no 
particular focus of bleeding source could be identified.  The NG 
lavage was clear, and pt remained hemodynamically stable.  Pt's 
hematocrit was 25.8 on admission and remained stable after 2 
units PRBCs in the 28-30 range.  There was no further evidence 
of bleed.  Of note, pt's INR was 1.1 during his hospitalization 
(was 7.7 initially at outside hospital, where pt received 8 
units PRBC and 6 units FFP).  PPI was given bid, and pt was sent 
out on bid PPI for an acute GI bleed.  Coumadin was held for one 
week per GI recommendations, as was aspirin for 2 weeks.  Follow 
up endoscopy is recommended in 6 months.
 
2.  atrial fibrillation - pt was noted to have [**1-19**] second pauses 
reportedly while on telemetry in the FICU.  His BB was stopped 
in the context of an acute GI bleed and in the setting of these 
pauses, as it was noted that pt has bifascicular block.  When pt 
reached the floor, an EP consult was called.  Pt was placed on 
telemetry and monitored, and he remained tachycardic in 120s.  
It was decided to try to reinstitute beta blocker and monitor on 
telemetry for pauses.  The maximum length of pause that was seen 
at a dose of BB sufficient for rate control was 1.6 seconds.  
Therefore, it was recommended that pt not undergo pacer 
placement, and he was sent home on lopressor 50mg po bid for 
rate control of atrial fibrillation.  As noted above, coumadin 
was held temporarily in setting of acute GI bleed.

3.  coronary artery disease - s/p CABG, with small troponin leak 
in setting of GI bleed.  This was thought to be due to demand 
ischemia.  Pt did not rule in for an MI.  Aspirin was held, as 
was his statin initially; the latter was begun on arrival to the 
floor.  ACE inhibitor was begun, as well; pt will require 
monitoring as an outpatient to check potassium and renal 
function.

4.  acute renal failure - Cr was initially elevated to 2.6 at 
outside hospital, trended down to 1.7 with volume resuscitation, 
suggesting prerenal azotemia.  Pt's Cr on discharge was at 
baseline of 1.4

5.  L arm swelling - the etiology of this was initially unclear. 
 Reportedly had a negative UENI recently.  Pt showed both 
weakness and pain and could not lift arm above head.  Plain 
films were unremarkable, showing mainly some osteoarthritis.  
MRI of shoulder showed rotator cuff tear, and MRI of neck showed 
cervical spondylosis, which also may have been contributing to 
pain.  Results of these MRI studies were printed on patient's 
discharge paperwork - will follow up with PCP and may require 
consultation with orthopedic surgeon. 

6.  agitation - pt has h/o of ICU psychosis, became agitated 
while in FICU.  Pt was given Haldol prn, and had no further 
problems with agitation on arrival to the floor.

7.  chronic steroids - pt with adrenal insufficiency due to 
chronic steroids - was put on solumedrol initially while in the 
FICU.  Fingersticks revealed hyperglycemia, which was a problem 
throughout entire hospital stay.  Pt had never used insulin 
before but was requiring insulin sliding scale with each check; 
his glucose was running in the 200s.  Pt's PCP was called, and 
it was arranged for pt to see PCP the following morning to get 
his glucose checked and possibly to get a glucometer and insulin 
teaching.

Discharge Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor in the next [**1-19**] 
weeks.  Please call your PCP if [**Doctor First Name **] notice any blood in your 
stool or dark, tarry stools, or if [**Doctor First Name **] have palpitations or feel 
short of breath.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please call Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 7146**] office first thing in the morning - he 
said he will see [**Doctor First Name **] tomorrow about your high sugars.
 

 
We recommend that [**Doctor First Name **] begin your coumadin and aspirin again in 2 
weeks. [**Doctor First Name 10**] will also need a followup EGD (which is the same kind 
of endoscopy [**Doctor First Name **] had here, where they looked into your stomach 
with the camera) in 6 weeks, to make sure that your ulcer is not 
bleeding. Until [**Doctor First Name **] get the endoscopy, [**Doctor First Name **] will need to take 
your Protonix twice a day. If the endoscopy shows that [**Doctor First Name **] are 
not still bleeding, then your PCP may recommend that [**Doctor First Name **] take 
the Protonix only once a day. 
 

 
[**Doctor First Name 10**] have been started on a new medicine for your high blood 
pressure, called lisinopril. [**Doctor First Name 10**] will need to have your 
potassium and renal function checked within one week.
 

 
[**Doctor First Name 10**] may need to be on an oral medication for your high sugar. 
Your glucose has been consistently high in the hospital, in the 
200s. It is likely that this is because of the prednisone [**Doctor First Name **] 
are taking. If [**Doctor First Name **] will take the prednisone chronically, [**Doctor First Name **] may 
need to take a medicine to keep your sugars under better 
control. [**Doctor First Name 10**] will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tomorrow for this.
 

 
We recommend that [**Doctor First Name **] get an appointment with an orthopedic 
surgeon near [**Doctor First Name **], as the MRI that we did showed the following: 
(results were placed on paperwork for pt to show PCP; please see 
pertinent results section for the information)

     C SPINE 4 VIEWS (WITH OBLIQUES):
     
     No priors for comparison. The cervical vertebra are visualized to the level of
     C6/7. Sternotomy wires noted. There is extensive joint space narrowing,
     subchondral sclerosis, and anterior osteophytosis at the levels of C4/5, C5/6,
     and C6/7. Additionally, best demonstrated on the oblique views, there are
     osteophytes moderately encroaching into the neural foraminal canals
     bilaterally at the levels of C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7. Otherwise, there is no
     evidence of fracture and there is satisfactory alignment of the cervical

     acromioclavicular joint. There is perhaps minimal raising of the humeral head,
     which could be consistent with a rotator cuff injury, however, this cannot be
     assessed by plain film.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
     2) Mild AC joint DJD, and minimal superior raising of the humeral head, which
     may be consistent with a rotator cuff injury, which could be further assessed
     by MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 14095**] indicated.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     MR OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Spondylosis and upper extremity weakness.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and T2 weighted images and axial T2 weighted and
     gradient echo images were obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  Each of the discs of the level screened, C2-C7 is narrowed and at
     each level there are bilateral disc/osteophyte complexes.  Endplate
     degenerative changes are noted, as seen on the plain film from 2 days
     previously.  There is mild relative stenosis of the left C2-3 foramen.  There
     is moderate C3-4 foraminal stenosis.
     
     At C4-5, there is some indentation of the thecal sac but no clear flattening
     of the spinal cord.  There is mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis
     minimally worse on the left than the right.
     
     At C5-6, there is fairly severe left foraminal stenosis, as seen on the plain
     film.  There is mild right foraminal stenosis.
     
     At C6-7, there is also severe left foraminal stenosis from the disc/osteophyte
     complex.  Mild right foraminal stenosis is seen.
     
     The C7-T1 foramina are well maintained.  There is minimal anterolisthesis of
     C7 on T1.
     
     The spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity and there is no spinal
     cord compression.  The craniovertebral junction is normal.
     
     IMPRESSION:  There is multilevel moderate to severe spondylosis.  There is
     bony stenosis of multiple foramina, particularly the left C5-6 and C6-7
     foramina.  No spinal cord compression is seen.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: 79-year-old man with left arm pain and weakness of one week's
     duration.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial, coronal and sagittal proton density and T2-weighted images
     were performed through the left shoulder. Coronal inversion recovery-weighted
     images were also performed.
     
     LEFT SHOULDER MR: There is a moderate-sized joint effusion with debris within
     it. Also there is fluid in the subacromial and subdeltoid bursa. There are
     complete tears of the supraspinatus tendon and infraspinatus tendon with
     retraction of their respective muscles. Additionally there is high signal
     within their respective muscles consistent with atrophy. There is also high
     signal within the subscapularis tendon on proton density-weighted sequence
     suggestive of a tear. The teres minor tendon is intact.
     
     There is a high riding humeral head. There are osteophytes on the glenoid and
     within the AC joint. There is thinning of both the humeral head and glenoid
     cartilage. The biceps tendon is torn, and there is retraction of the tendon.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Torn supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and biceps tendons with
     atrophy of their associated muscles.
     2. Fluid in glenohumeral joint and subacromial/subdeltoid bursa.
