Admission Date:  [**3321-3-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**3321-3-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**3231-10-18**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CMED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year-old
white female with a history of severe aortic stenosis with a
valve area of 0.6 cm squared and also a history of
hypertension who was transferred from an outside hospital
where she was treated for congestive heart failure.  The
patient had been admitted to an outside hospital in [**State 1877**]
after having shortness of breath and increasing lower
extremity edema.  She was found to have an echocardiogram
with ST depressions.  She was thought to have a left lower
lobe infiltrate, however, they also checked a BMP, which
showed an elevation of 2300. Her troponin I was mildly
elevated at 0.26 and her CK peak was 115.  She ruled out for
a myocardial infarction.  Chest x-ray was suggestive of
volume overload.  She was treated with intravenous Lasix and
improved fairly quickly, however, she had a recurrent episode
of shortness of breath again treated with Lasix and morphine.
 It was thought that her congestive heart failure was due to
her aortic stenosis.  Consequently she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 75**] for evaluation for
aortic valvuloplasty.

When the patient arrived, she had no complaints of dyspnea,
chest pain, nausea and vomiting.  She reports having been
able to walk without dyspnea prior to this episode.  She
lives in an assisted living facility and was able to walk up
stairs without any difficulty.  She denies any history of
syncope or chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.6 cm squared.
2.  Pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome.  She has a DDD pacer.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypothyroidism for which her cardiolgoist keeps her
mildly hypothyroid given her history of aortic stenosis.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Breast cancer status post mastectomy.
7.  Appendectomy.
8.  Dementia.
9.  History of sundowning.
10.  History of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
11.  History of falls.
12.  Cervical arthritis.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin, which causes hives.  She initially came
in with a report of having sulfa and an Amoxicillin
allergies, but she denies this as does her daughter.

1.  Metoprolol 2.5 mg po q.d.
2.  Thiamine 100 mg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She quit smoking more then 30 years ago and
smoked for only three years.  She lives in an assisted living
facility in [**State 1877**].  She has a very involved daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.7.  Heart rate 65.
Respiratory rate 18.  Blood pressure 76 to 88 systolic over
46 to 70 diastolic.  97% on room air.  Weight 120.5 pounds.
No acute distress.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.
Extraocular movements intact.  Neck supple.  No
lymphadenopathy with JVD approximately 2 to ear.  Pulmonary
no wheezes or crackles.  Cardiac S1 and S2.  Normal with a
harsh systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal
border.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities warm, no pitting
edema. Neurological the patient was oriented to name and
place.  She had no focal weakness.

Echocardiogram done in [**3320-8-16**] showed an EF of greater
then 55% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, 2+ mitral
regurgitation, with aortic valve area of 0.6 cm squared with
a pressure gradient of 146 peak and a mean of 90.
Electrocardiogram was V paced with 70 beats per minute.

LABORATORIES UPON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 4.5,
hematocrit 36, platelets 129, sodium 137, potassium 4.0,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, BUN 19, creatinine 1.4,
initially at 1.6, glucose 78, magnesium 2.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  The patient had ruled out for
an myocardial infarction.  She had symptoms of congestive
heart failure at the outside hospital, but during this
admission stay she did not have any further evidence of
dyspnea.  She was continued on her Lasix and her beta
blocker.  She was switched over the Metoprolol during this
hospital stay, because of availability of the medication.
She was evaluated for a valvuloplasty.  Cardiac Surgery saw
her and considered aortic valve replacement.  However, the
family and the patient did not want to undergo surgery.
Consequently she was sent for aortic valvuloplasty.  During
the aortic valvuloplasty she had a cardiac catheterization
looking at her coronary arteries, which revealed a proximal
right coronary artery lesion of 30%, otherwise no significant
stenosis.  She had a valvuloplasty, which led to a change in
the gradient from 89 to 60 and a valve area that only changed
merely from 0.38 to 0.45.  She was sent to the cardiac care
unit for observation.  She had no events during her stay in
the CCU.  She was then transferred back to the floor where
she had no further events of dyspnea.  She was continued on
her Lasix.  Her Metoprolol had been held temporarily, because
of decreased blood pressure.  However, after the
valvuloplasty her blood pressure had improved and she was
restarted on her Metoprolol.  She was also seen by the
Electrophysiology Service, because of possible decreased
____________.  On their evaluation they found that her
pacemaker battery was low.  It was therefore changed.  She
had physical therapy in which she was felt to return to her
previous living situation.

2.  Renal:  The patient had an elevated creatinine initially.
 It improved during the course of this admission and may have
been a reflection of having been overdiuresed with
intravenous Lasix.  She was continued on gentle diuresis with
po Lasix.

3.  Hematology:  The patient had a steady decrease in her
hematocrit during this hospital admission particularly after
her valvuloplasty and may have had some blood loss during the
procedure.  Her groin sites did not appear to have a
hematoma.  She was transfused with one unit of packed red
blood cells on [**3321-3-20**] and her hematocrit responded
appropriately.  Her discharge hematocrit is approximately
29%.  Her platelets also decreased during the course of this
hospital stay.  She initially came in at 140,000 and had a
nadir of 90,000.  She received some heparin during the
course of the valvuloplasty, but her platelets have been
decreasing prior to that.  Upon discharge her platelets are
112,000, but should be followed up as an outpatient.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient had an elevated TSH of 14.
However, this had been the intended goal with her history of
aortic stenosis and no adjustments were made in her
Levothyroxine.

5.  Code status:  The patient's code status was determined to
be DNR/DNI as per discussions with the patient and her
daughter.  During the course of the procedure it was reversed
to full code, but after returned to DNR status.

The patient is to be discharged back to her assisted living
facility in [**State 1877**].  She will need to follow up with her
cardiologist concerning her aortic stenosis as there is a
high rate of recurrence of restenosis in the setting of
valvuloplasty.  She will also need to be followed up by her
primary care physician concerning her anemia and
thrombocytopenia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Effexor XR 37.5 mg po q.d.
2.  Evista 60 mg po q.d.
3.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg po q.d.
4.  Serax 10 mg po q.h.s. prn as needed for insomnia.
5.  Thiamine 100 mg po q.d.
6.  Levothyroxine 50 micrograms po q.d.
7.  Multivitamin tablet one tablet po q.d.
8.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.
9.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.

The patient will be discharged to her assisted living
facility in [**State 1877**] where she will need some VNA for her
medications and rehab and for physical therapy.  She will
also need follow up with her primary care physician for her
anemia and thrombocytopenia.  She will need to follow up with
her cardiolgoist there for her aortic stenosis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.
