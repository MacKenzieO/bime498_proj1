Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left IJ hemodialysis catheter placement
Right IJ central line placement
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG 
x 2, CHF EF 20%, AFIB, DM2 who presented on [**2889-2-6**] with 
worsening DOE x 4 weeks, cough, and increased LE edema. Pt 
reports that 4 weeks prior to presentation, he would be able to 
climb 10 steps and walk [**12-1**] mile w/o dyspnea - DOE has slowly 
progressed such that today not able to walk 20 feet w/o dyspnea. 
Denies dyspnea at rest. Pt also states that he had noticed 
increased LE edema over past 4 weeks before admission. Finally, 
he states he has had a cough productive of white sputum x 4 
weeks; worse at night and interferes w/ his ability to [**Doctor Last Name 314**].  
On presentation, the patient denied any CP, but stated that one 
week prior he felt non-radiating sharp substernal CP after 
climbing 1 flight of stairs. +dyspnea -diaphoresis, -N/V. He has 
been prescribed SL NTG in past, but never has needed it - during 
this episode, however, he wished he had it at the time. CP 
dissipated after resting for 10 minutes and did not recur.  

Does not actively monitor salt intake. Has increased fluid 
intake (2-3 L/day now) b/c of sensation of dry mouth when wakes 
up. General malaise has resulted in missing some medication 
doses. Pt's PCP was going to start him on digoxin for his AF but 
the prescription has not been filled b/c of dosing error 
(prescribed 0.1 mg every other day). Has been taking tylenol (2 
tabs 2-3 times daily) for generally unwell feeling. Has been 
seen multiple times by PCP for worsening DOE. Work-up included 
CXR ([**2-1**] - no evidence CHF, no infiltrate), echo (EF 20%) and 
blood cx to r/o endocarditis (pending).  

ROS: + rhinorrhea, decreased appetite. +wt gain, but not sure 
how much. Denies orthopnea, PND (but sleeps w/ two pillows for 
GERD), fevers, chills, night sweats, change in bowel or bladder 
habits, BRBPR, melena, hematuria, visual changes, weakness in 
arms or legs. pain in L shoulder w/ movement (longstanding

Other Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2889-2-14**] 7:10 AM
1. Slightly improving interstitial pulmonary edema.
2. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right upper lobar 
artery.

RENAL U.S.  [**2889-2-10**] 9:55 AM
IMPRESSION: Diminished intrarenal arterial diastolic flow 
suggesting chronic small vessel disease. Otherwise, normal renal 
ultrasound with no hydronephrosis or evidence for renal artery 
stenosis.

ESOPHAGUS  [**2889-2-17**] 3:08 PM
D[**MD Number 1142**] the initial swallows, there was no evidence of 
aspiration. However, after consecutive sips of thick dye and the 
patient aspirated a small amount. The cough was partially 
effective in clearing the aspirated barium.
The motility of the esophagus appears satisfactory. In the 
anterior aspect of the distal third of the esophagus there is 
some irregularity which was incompletely evaluated in this 
study. This should be further evaluated when the patient comes 
down tomorrow for a video swallow.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild aspiration during the study. Recommend evaluation by the 
speech and swallow therapist with a video swallow fluoroscopy.
REPEAT BARIUM SWALLOW [**2-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Extrinsic compression upon anterior distal 
esophagus. If there 
is further clinical concern recommend followup CT exam. 

VIDEO SWALLOW: mildly reduced oral control and mild pharyngeal 
residue in the valleculae with all consistencies. Pt also had 
trace penetration before the swallow with both thin and nectar 
thick liquids, but he completely cleared the penetration and no 
aspiration was seen during this study. Based on this study, pt 
is safe for thin liquids and regular consistency solids. Pt will 
need to perform repeat swallows as needed to clear the 
pharyngeal residue which he is sensate to, and often coughs in 
response to. Spontaneous coughs during this evaluation were 
never due to 
aspiration.  
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. suggest pt continue with a PO diet of thin liquids and 
regular 
consistency solids.  
2. Pills whole with thin liquids.  
3. Continue with esophageal work- up, especially for reflux, as 
many of the pt's symptoms may coincide with reflux.  

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2889-2-18**] 9:04 PM:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a left internal 
jugular line terminating in the distal SVC. There are extensive 
vascular calcifications. There are multiple small mediastinal 
lymph[**MD Number 65**]. There are multifocal patchy areas of consolidation 
in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and 
bilateral lower lobes. There is a focal area of calcification at 
the dome of the liver. There is an axial type hiatal hernia. No 
abnormal masses producing extrinsic compression of the esophagus 
are identified. There is no definite esophageal wall thickening 
with areas of the mid esophagus that are underfilled and thus 
difficult to evaluate for wall thickening.
Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No abnormal masses producing extrinsic compression of the 
esophagus are identified. There is no definite wall thickening, 
with evaluation of the mid esophagus limited due to under 
filling.
2. Small axial type hiatal hernia.
3. Extensive vascular calcifications including dense coronary 
artery calcifications in this patient that appears to be status 
post CABG.
4. Multiple patchy opacities in the lungs concerning for 
multifocal pneumonia. Given this patient's documented aspiration 
on the recent barium swallow, this is likely contributory.

  
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital3 **] Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2889-2-6**] on the [**Hospital1 **] APG service. He was 
fluid overloaded with CHF and was diuresed to be negative 3L, 
however in the setting of decompenstated HF, aggressive 
diuresis, and initiation of an ACEI, he developed acute renal 
failure. Despite discontinuation of all diuretics and 
renal-toxic medications, his creatinine continued to rise over 
the next two days to 4.2.  Additionally, his blood pressures 
remained very low (80s-100s SBP), though he was asymptomatic and 
not orthostatic.  Accordingly, he was transferred to the CCU for 
CHF decompensation on [**2889-2-10**].

In the CCU, a central line and swan were placed and the patient 
was initially maintained on dopamine and vasopressin. His 
initial numbers were : PCW 33 on admission to CCU , PAP 63/29, 
CO 4.4, CI 2.07, SVR 855, SVO2 58% --> CO 5.2, CI 2.44 SVR 877, 
SvO2 61% off milrinone.  

In addition, he had been on milrinone until [**2889-2-14**]. In the CCU, 
renal was consulted and CCVH was initiated with HD through a 
left IJ line. At the end of his CCU course, the patient was a 
total of 3.8 liters negative. On [**2889-2-15**], the day of transfer to 
the floor, the patient had diuresed 1 liter the day before on 
CVVH and was 200 cc+ until noon with little urine output prior 
to transfer on metalazone and lasix 80 mg PO QD. 

He was transferred back to the medicine service on [**2-14**].  
Diuresis was resumed with lasix and metalozone, with good urine 
output and stable creatinine at his baseline.  

From a respiratory stand point, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**] improved 
substantially with diuresis; he was able to ambulate without 
dyspnea, limited only by deconditioning.  His significant lower 
extremity edema, however, persisted.

Hospital Course By Issues: 
 
Cardiac:  
CHF Exacerbation: The etiology of this exacerbation is not 
clear, however might be in part due to increasing fluid intake 
and salt indiscretion.  While he was ruled out for MI during 
this hospitalization, it is possible he previously had an 
ischemic event which contributed to this exacerbation

On admission, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**]' CHF regimen included: furosemide 80 mg 
daily, metolazone 5 mg daily, and spironolactone/HCTZ 25/25 mg 
daily.  He had previously been on a BB but it was discontinued 
as he is believed to have pulmonary disease, which was 
exacerbated the BB.  It could not be determined whether he had 
previously been on an ACEI.  His outpatient diuretics were 
continued, though lasix was change to IV and administered BID, 
and an ACEI was started.  In this setting he developed ARF and 
was transferred as detailed above to the CCU for tailored 
therapy.  Furthermore, he was hypotensive (80s-100s SBP), though 
he was asymptomatic from this.

His regimen on discharge is lasix and metalozone BID and he was 
diuresing well to this regimen with stable creatinine.  He was 
also started on digoxin 0.125 mg daily.  As Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**] has an 
appointment with the Heart Failure clinic, further modification 
of his CHF regimen was deferred.  He was not restarted on a BB 
given his history of exacerbation of respiratory dyspnea with 
atenolol and onset of ARF inconjunction with starting an ACEI 
during this hospitalization. 

He should have a repeat echocardiogram when he is euvolemic to 
assess his actual EF and to guide decisions regarding the need 
for AICD.

CAD: 
- Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**] has a history of CABG x 2, 1976 and 1987 and was 
ruled out for MI. In [**2880**], cath showed 3VD and occlusion of 3/6 
grafts.
- He was continued on ASA and lipitor 80.  BB was felt to be 
contraindicated given his history of pulmonary exacerbation and 
his relative hypotension.
-[**Name2 (NI) **] should follow-up with his cardiologist as an outpatient to 
discuss the role for cardiac catheterization when he is 
euvolemic for hemodynamic assessment and to evaluate for 
ischemic contribution to his worsening CHF.
  
# Rhythm: AFIB since [**2883**].  
-Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**] was monitored on telemetry during his stay - he was 
in afib but HR was routinely in the 70s-90s
-he was started on digoxin 0.125 mg daily; it was felt a 
beta-blocker was contraindicated as detailed previously. 
- He was anticoagulated with heparin gtt while in the CCU then 
transitioned to coumadin with a goal INR [**12-31**] 

# Acute on chronic renal failure:  
- Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6718**]' Cr rose from his baseline of 2.0 to a peak of 4.1, 
but returned to his baseline after CVVH in the CCU.  His ARF was 
likely multifactorial (low-flow state in the setting of 
decompensated CHF, aggressive diuresis, ACEI).  Renal US showed 
no hydro or renal a stenosis and urine lytes showed a prerenal 
state.
- Many of his medications were discontinued in the setting of 
ARF and were not restarted at discharge given his CRF.  These 
include glyburide, metformin, and colchicine.
 
#. Cough: likely multifactorial - secondary to pulmonary 
congestion, related to pneumonia. 
-Pneumonia - Sputum culture + for H. influenzae, placed on levo 
7 day course (renally adjusted). 
-given the history of exacerbation of cough after drinking 
fluids, a video swallow was performed which did not demonstrate 
aspiration.

#. Elevated alk phos - has had cholecystectomy in past. Likely 
related to CHF, especially as level as increased as CHF has 
worsened.  Unlikely cholestasis or congestion given normal LFTs, 
normal bili, and ******normal GGT.  
 
# DM2:  discontinued glyburide and metformin given a creatinine 
clearance of 35. Started on glargine 8, and RISS. At discharge, 
the pt's creatinine had improved and he was restarted on 
glargine per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 6719**] recs.

# Anemia:  
- Baseline Hct 39-40, this month has ranged 28-30. 
- Iron studies show chronic disease. 
-Started epogen qM,W,F and continued iron supplementation.
.
# Hematuria/UTI  
-Urine: no longer grossly bloody after removal of foley, only 
[**1-30**] RBCs on microscopic eval of urine --> hematuria resolved. Pt 
with UTI treated with levofloxacin.

# Esophageal motility
- Pt was evaluated for possible aspiration and found to not be 
aspirating. Additionally, there was a question of something 
compressing the anterior distal esophagus. This was further 
evaluated with a CT scan which was normal.

# FEN: Placed on low Na, cardiac/DM diet, 1L IVF restriction. 
Electrolytes were carefully monitored and repleted prn.  Patient 
was placed on standing Mg 800 mg BID.

Secondary Diagnoses:
Coronary Artery Disease
Atrial Fibrillation
Diabetes Mellitus
Chronic Renal Insufficiency
Anemia

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, with less dyspnea and clearer lungs, with renal function 
at baseline, but with persistent lower extremity edema.

 
Discharge Instructions:
[**Doctor First Name 10**] were hospitalized at [**Hospital1 83**] for exacerbation of your 
congestive heart failure.  The cause of this exacerbation is not 
certain, but may be related to increased fluid intake and 
excessive salt intake.  After trying to remove some of the 
excessive fluid with lasix, your kidney function worsened.  
Accordingly, [**Doctor First Name **] were transferred to the ICU for tailored 
therapy including a form of dialysis, to help remove excess 
fluid without injurying your kidneys.

During the course of your hospital stay, approximately 
****XXXX**** liters of excess fluid was removed.  Your weight at 
the time of discharge from the hospital was ******.

1. Take all medications as prescribed.  Some of your medications 
were discontinued (including metformin and colchicine) given 
your worsened kidney function. At the moment, your diuretic 
regimen (water pills) includes lasix and metalazone; [**Doctor First Name **] should 
take both medications twice daily. [**Doctor First Name 10**] were started on Epogen 
for anemia (low red blood cell counts), digoxin for your heart 
failure and atrial fibrillation, and a short course of 
levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Your coumadin was subtherapeutic at 
the time of discharge, so [**Doctor First Name **] are receiving lovenox shots until 
your coumadin is therapeutic.

2. Keep all appointments with your medical care providers (see 
below).

3. [**Doctor First Name 10**] should contact your doctor or return to the hospital if 
[**Doctor First Name **]:
-notice an increase in your weight of more than 2 lbs ([**Doctor First Name **] 
should weigh yourself daily)
-notice an increase in leg swelling, or increased shortness of 
breath, worsened cough, become short of breat when lying flat, 
or frequent awaken in the night short of breath
-chest pain/tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, 
nausea/vomiting, decreased exercise tolerance (becoming short of 
breath with less exertion than previously)
-fevers, uncontrollable shaking chills
-lightheadedness, particularly on standing
-coughing up blood, blood in your urine or stools
-any other symptoms that are concerning to [**Doctor First Name **].
