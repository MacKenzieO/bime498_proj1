SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is do not resuscitate, do not intubate.
She lives alone.  Her son [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49**] is her health
care proxy.  His phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5990**].  Her
granddaughter is [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 2659**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5991**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5992**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  She was afebrile 97.1.
Pulse 81.  Blood pressure 152/70.  Respiratory rate 17.  O2
sat 98%.  She is in no acute distress.  Alert, awake and
oriented times three.  She has a nasogastric tube in place to
low continuous suction.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  She was mildly kyphotic.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm with a loud murmur.  Abdomen she has
a well healed scar in the lower mid abdomen.  She was soft
distended, tympanitic, tender in the left lower quadrant to
deep palpation.  No rebound or guarding.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with no masses by the Emergency Department staff.
Extremities showed no edema.

CT scan on admission showed contrast to the proximal jejunum
with a transition point in the right lower quadrant.  There
is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis and also
along the inferior pole of the liver.  There is no evidence
of bowel ischemia.  The abdominal x-ray showed an opacity of
gas in the rectum.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 11.3, hematocrit 40.8,
platelets 168, 91% neutrophils.  Her chem 7 sodium 128,
potassium 3.9, chloride 90, bicarb 25, BUN 12, creatinine
0.7, glucose 155.  Liver function tests ALT 11, AST 21,
alkaline phosphatase 131, total bili 0.6, amylase 55.
Urinalysis did show evidence of a urinary tract infection and
urine culture from admission ended up showing alpha
streptococcus growing in her urine.  Her electrocardiogram
was unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient has early small bowel
obstruction.  She was consented and taken to the Operating
Room for an exploratory laparotomy.  After she was consented
and she was about to undergo surgery she underwent the
exploratory laparotomy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with the assistance of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5993**].  Please refer to the previously dictated operative
note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  In short they did an exploratory
laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.  They also did an
appendectomy as well as repair of multiple serosal injuries.
There surgical findings were dense adhesions throughout the
abdomen with a transition point proximal to the appendix in
the terminal ileum.  Postoperatively, the patient was sent to
the Intensive Care Unit where cardiology evaluated her and
she was started on a Diltiazem drip and ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  In addition, her atrial fibrillation
during this part of her Intensive Care Unit stay, she was
rate controlled with a Diltiazem drip.  In addition she
received full doses for hypovolemia as well as she was
transfused for chronic blood loss anemia.  After improvement
after several days she was transferred out to the floor on
postoperative day two where she stayed for one day and then
until on postoperative day three she experienced several
episodes of respiratory distress where she was noted to be
tachypneic with decreasing oxygen saturation on both room air
and face mask.  Later on postoperative day three she was
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit where she was
intubated.

Chest films at this time showed marked fluid overload at
stake with bilateral pleural effusions and signs of
congestive heart failure.  She was diuresed over the next few
days.  Several sputum cultures during this time revealed the
presence of yeast as well as gram negative rods within her
sputum.  She was started on antibiotics for presumed
aspiration pneumonia.  On postoperative day six the patient
self extubated herself and was not reintubated due to her
DNR/DNI status and also the fact that she seemed to be
tolerating oxygenation via face mask.  On postoperative day
[**2570-7-24**] the patient was started on enteral feedings,
which she tolerated without nausea, vomiting, aspiratory
symptoms or abdominal pain.  At this time her family and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] and the Intensive Care Unit team discussed the patient's
code status and as of discharge the patient is currently do
not resuscitate, do not perform shocks or chest compressions
on her.  This is the latest order in terms of that.  However,
she is to be intubated for respiratory failure.  This,
however, should be confirmed by her family as to her current
status.

On postoperative day eleven the patient was receiving tube
feeds to goal and her total parenteral nutrition was
discontinued.  She was screened and accepted at High Gate
Rehab Facility.  She was discharged in stable condition to
that facility in the afternoon on that day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Afebrile.  Pulse 93.
Blood pressure 174/74.  Respirations 28.  96% on room air.
She was tolerating enteral tube feeds with good urine output.
 She was minimally responsive.  She had decreased breath
sounds bilaterally with cackles.  Her abdomen was soft,
nondistended.  The wound was clean, dry and intact and her
extremities showed no edema.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Status post appendectomy.
3.  Status post lysis of adhesions.
4.  Status post repair of serosal injuries times five.
5.  Hypovolemia requiring fluid resuscitation.
6.  Hypomagnesia.
7.  Hypocalcemia.
8.  Chronic blood loss anemia requiring multiple
transfusions.
9.  Congestive heart failure fluid overload.
10.  Respiratory distress.
11.  Pulmonary edema.
12.  Hypoalimentation.
13.  Urinary tract infection.
14.  Aspiration pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zosyn 2.25 mg intravenous q 6 for four more days.
2.  Diltiazem 60 mg po four times a day.
3.  Pepcid 20 mg po twice a day.
4.  Dulcolax 10 mg prn once a day as needed for constipation.
5.  Albuterol nebulizer q 6 prn.
6.  Combivent four puffs q 4 hours.
7.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po three times a week.
8.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po three times a
week.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She needs physical therapy for
activity.  She also has a Foley that should be placed to
gravity and she has a central line that should remain in
place as long as she is receiving Zosyn antibiotics.  This
should be discontinued after the antibiotics are discontinued
in four days.  She should have a follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in
two weeks.

     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION:  Abdominal pain and vomiting.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired images were obtained through the abdomen and
     pelvis after 100 cc Optiray.  Coronal images were reformatted.
     
     CONTRAST:  Non-ionic contrast was provided because of the patient's debility.
     
     Comparison is made to [**2647-5-11**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There are dilated loops of small bowel with
     multiple air-fluid levels.  The bowel measures up to 3.5 cm in diameter.  A
     transition point is seen within the right lower quadrant and there is a long
     segment of decompressed distal ileum.  There are no areas of small bowel wall
     thickening. There is no portal venous or mesenteric air. The large bowel is
     full of air and stool and is mostly decompressed.  There is a small amount of
     free fluid within the pelvis. There is no free air.
     
     Several small cysts are seen within the liver.  There are no enhancing liver
     masses.  There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The spleen, kidneys,
     and adrenal glands are grossly normal.  There is no abnormal adenopathy within
     the abdomen or pelvis.
     
     CT PELVIS AFTER IV CONTRAST:  There are extensive vascular calcifications
     along the aorta.  There are coarse calcifications at the origins of the celiac
     axis and SMA.  Both of these vessels are patent and show robust contrast
     enhancement.  Calcification of the coronary arteries and of the mitral valve
     annulus are also identified. A small loculated fluid collection is seen within
     the right groin, unchanged. Degenerative changes are seen within the spine.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval development of a small bowel obstruction with transition
     point in the right lower quadrant.  There is a small amount of free fluid
     within the pelvis and also along the inferior pole of the liver. There is no
     evidence of bowel ischemia.
     
                                                                 (Over)
