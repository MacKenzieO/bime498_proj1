                                     FINAL REPORT
     MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION:  Uterine cancer with lung masses and left parietal lesion.
     
     Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were obtained without and
     with intravenous gadolinium administration according to standard departmental
     protocol.  Comparison is made to the prior exam from [**2830-9-28**].
     
     There has been slight enlargement of the previously seen large cystic mass
     lesion in the left parietal convexity, which now measures 4.1 x 3.8 x 2.6 cm.
     This probably contains viscous proteinaceous material or byproducts of blood.
     The mass demonstrates increased T1 and T2 signal without significant
     surrounding vasogenic edema seen.  Enlargement of the mass would suggest a
     malignant process.  There are no acute territorial infarcts seen on diffusion
     images.  Few scattered foci of nonspecific T2 hyperintensity are present along
     the periventricular white matter.  There is no abnormal meningeal enhancement
     seen.
     
     Sagittal images reveals expanding and worsening metastatic disease in the
     epidural space arising from C3 and C5 vertebra and resulting in moderate cord
     compression, which is posteriorly deviated.  Followup MRI of the cervical
     spine would be recommended for further evaluation.  The brainstem is
     unremarkable.  There is opacification of the right maxillary sinus.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Slight enlargement of the cystic mass lesion, which contains
     isointense internal signal and no enhancement in the left posterior parietal
     convexity.  The mass has enlarged by 5-6 mm since [**2830-9-28**] and is
     worrisome for malignancy.  There are worsening expanding metastatic lesions
     involving the upper cervical spine, most notably at C3 level, resulting in
     deviation of the cord posteriorly and compression.  There is metastatic
     involvement of C2 and C5 as well.  Followup MRI of the cervical spine would be
     recommended along with neurosurgical consultation.

     HISTORY:  C3 fracture.
     
     Lung cancer with metastatic disease.
     
     On the lateral view, C1 through the T1-T2 disc space is demonstrated.  There
     is severe diffuse osteopenia.  There is marked compression and ill definition
     of the C3 vertebral body, with convex bowing of the posterior portion of the
     vertebral body extending into the spinal canal, similar to the [**2830-9-28**] MRI. In
     addition, there is irregularity with multiple lucencies involving the C5
     vertebral body, also consistent with metastatic disease.  No retropulsion or
     retrolisthesis is identified at this level.  There are moderately severe
     degenerative changes at C6/7, with disc space narrowing and small marginal
     osteophytes.  Remaining vertebral body heights are preserved.  Prevertebral
     soft tissues are slightly prominent.  The known C3 posterior element disease
     seen on the recent MRI is difficult to appreciate on this x-ray.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Destruction and compression of C3 and C5 vertebral bodies,
     consistent with metastatic disease.  Retropulsion of the posterior cortex at
     C3 unchanged compared with [**2830-9-28**] C-spine MRI.  Otherwise, no bony compromise
     of the spinal canal is detected.  Advanced degenerative change is noted.

     AP CHEST 8:16 P.M. ON [**2830-11-3**].
     
     HISTORY:  New hypoxia.  Lung masses and pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-2**].
     
     Lung volumes are smaller.  There is probably a moderate-sized right pleural
     effusion but it is difficult to separate growing mass in the right middle lobe
     and right middle lobe atelectasis in the base of the right lung and therefore
     to determine the volume of right pleural effusion.  Drop in left lung volume
     seems to be due to relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
     
     Two masses in the left mid lung appear to be smaller and cavitated
     respectively.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the elevated diaphragm. 
     Right lower paratracheal and mediastinal adenopathy persists.  No
     pneumothorax.

     EMERGENCY CERVICAL SPINE IMAGING STUDY.
     
     HISTORY:  Metastatic endometrial cancer with right upper and lower extremity
     weakness.  Status post fall.  Assess changes to cervical spine following the
     fall.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted imaging of the cervical spine was
     obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  This study is of poor quality due to patient motion.
     
     Comparison with the prior study of [**2830-9-28**], appears to show
     increasing amount of prevertebral edema, which is now prominent in extent and
     is seen from the level of the foramen magnum to C5.  There is somewhat
     increasing amount of edema in the spinous process of C3 as well.  These
     abnormalities could represent consequence of the recent trauma or an unusually
     rapid progression of metastatic disease, as well as a combination of the two
     factors. Infection is also possible, and requires clinical correlation.
     Pathologic fracture seen at C3 is redemonstrated and it, as well as the
     associated large epidural mass causes what appears to be moderately prominent
     cord compression. No other new foci of metastatic disease are apparent.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Worsening prevertebral edema in the upper cervical spine as well
     as within the spinous process of C3.  Taken together, these abnormalities are
     of concern for either the effects of recent trauma, rapidly progressive
     metastatic disease, or a combination of the two. Infection is a less likely
     consideration, without confirmatory clinical correlation.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN
     
     HISTORY:  Metastatic endometrial cancer with worsening weakness.  Assess for
     interval changes.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained with
     gadolinium enhancement.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2830-10-21**] study.
     
     There has been negligible alteration in the extent of the large left parietal
     ring enhancing mass, compared to the prior study of [**10-21**].  It is of
     interest that this large lesion has essentially no peripheral edema.  This
     finding is somewhat unusual, in the setting of either a primary or metastatic
     neoplasm.  Is the patient receiving any corticosteroid medication that might
     reduce the edematous component?  The T1 hyperintensity of the contents of this
     lesion, noted within the cavity, has diminished in extent.  This change could
     suggest that there could be a hemorrhagic component, as opposed to an
     alteration in the proteinaceous content of the abnormality.  There were no
     other areas of pathological enhancement seen within the brain.
     
     The mass causes minor compression of the trigone of the left lateral
     ventricle.  There is no shift of normally midline structures nor is there sign
     for hydrocephalus.  There is persistent loss of aeration of the right
     maxillary antrum, which could indicate an inflammatory process.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No new lesions are seen.  The left parietal mass is
     redemonstrated.  While a metastatic neoplastic focus would seem a reasonable
     consideration, given the widely metastatic disease elsewhere, a resolving
     hemorrhage could be considered, with infection being less likely.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Again seen is a cavitary lesion within the
     right mid lung zone, which is similar in appearance in comparison to prior
     study.  There is an opacity at the right lung base, which likely represents
     pleural effusion with atelectasis, though consolidation cannot be excluded. 
     There are rounded nodular opacities in the right hilar area, which correspond
     to a mass lesion seen on prior CT imaging from [**2830-10-10**].  The mediastinal and
     hilar contours are stable in appearance.  Soft tissue and osseous structures
     are stable.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Assess spine and hardware position.
     
     CERVICAL SPINE, TWO LATERAL VIEWS.  One appears to be a repeat for
     positioning.
     
     A halo is in place. C1 through the upper portion of C7 is demonstrated. The
     patient is status post occipital-cervical fusion with bilateral pedicle
     screws, with slin staples.  Screw positioning is grossly unremarkable on these
     views, but correlation with clinical findings and AP view would be recommended
     for full assessment.  Some increased lucency is seen about several of the
     screws, presumably related to initial insertion.  The C3 vertebral body is
     markedly abnormal --- it is ill-defined with areas of lysis and probable
     retropulsion of posterior fragments.  There is equivocal increased lucency in
     the lamina of C3.  There is relative osteopenia of the C4, C5 and C6 vertebral
     bodies.  The cortices at C5 are also ill defined.  This corresponds to
     findings on the [**2830-11-3**] C-spine MRI.
     
     No listhesis is identified. Degenerative changes at C6/7 are seen at the
     periphery of the film.
     
     At the periphery of these films, there is suggestion of small lucencies in the
     posterior skull, of indeterminate significance -- the ddx includes small
     metastatic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Status post occipital-cervical fusion in expected alignment on a
     single lateral view.  Extensive destruction of the C3 and to a lesser extent
     C5 vertebral bodies, with apparent lysis in C4 and C6 as well.  Correlation
     with complete clinical history is recommended.

     COMPARISON:  [**2830-11-4**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Cervical C-spine CT with sagittal and coronal reformatting.
     
     FINDINGS:  There has been interval laminectomy at C3.  A posterior fixation
     device with pedicle screws, bars, a cross-link and occipital screws is
     visualized. The inferior most extent is at the C6 vertebra while the superior
     extent is the occipital bone. Again noted is extensive loss of vertebral body
     height at the C3 and C5 levels, unchanged from the prior study.  The metallic
     artifact obscures bony detail. Visualized spinal cord is hard to evaluate.
     There is reduction in the retropulsion of C3 since the prior study of 10/24.
     A small amount of gas is seen in the operative bed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Postsurgical changes with laminectomy at C3 and posterior
     fixation as described. Improvement in the retropulsion at C3.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  As compared to [**11-10**], there is a left PICC
     which is not well seen but appears to terminate within the left
     brachiocephalic vein.  Tracheostomy tube remains in stable, satisfactory
     position.  Central lymphadenopathy and moderate right pleural effusion are
     unchanged.  Known right lower lobe collapse is again demonstrated.  Two
     cavitary lesions within the left lower lobe better seen on the CT chest from
     the same day are again noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Termination of left PICC line within the left brachiocephalic vein.
     2.  Persistent moderate right pleural effusion and right lower lobe collapse.
     3.  Two cavitary lesions within the left lower lobe.  In addition to
     metastatic disease, fungal infection should be considered.

     HISTORY:  Metastatic endometrial cancer, shortness of breath.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from [**2830-9-25**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images from the lung apices to lung
     bases were obtained before and after the administration of 100 cc of IV
     Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to rapid bolus
     requirement needed per protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
     performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  The pulmonary arterial
     vasculature is well visualized down to the subsegmental branches.  Filling
     defects are identified within the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
     arterial branches supplying the left lower lobe.  The aorta is normal in
     caliber without evidence of dissection.  The heart and great vessels are
     unchanged.  The pericardium appears unremarkable.
     
     Again, demonstrated is extensive lymphadenopathy involving the right
     paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and right hilar regions.  Extensive
     lymphadenopathy is not significantly changed since the prior examination.  A
     large right pleural effusion is again noted, which appears minimally decreased
     in size since the prior study.
     
     Lung window images again demonstrate multiple nodular opacities, two of which
     have increased in cavitation since the prior exam, and are located in the left
     lower lobe.  Additionally, within the left upper lobe, there is interval
     increase in size of an ill-defined nodular ground-glass opacity. Additionally,
     there is continued compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe. A
     tracheostomy tube is noted within trachea, superior to the carina. Within the
     proximal left mainstem bronchus, there appears to be possible endoluminal
     extension of a subcarinal mass vs. extraluminal compression from mass effect.
     
     In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, stable-appearing low-density
     lesion is again noted within the left lobe of the liver, likely representing a
     cyst.  No other abnormalities are seen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION:  Cervical spine surgery.
     
     CERVICAL SPINE:  Single intraoperative lateral view of the cervical spine was
     obtained.  The film is significantly limited due to overlying hardware.  There
     is a curved metallic pin with tip at the C5-C6 level.  Multilevel significant
     vertebral destructive abnormalities are present.  Posterior fixation hardware
     is present and does not appear significantly changed in comparison to prior
     cervical spine of [**2830-11-12**].  Of note, the upper most posterior fixation screws
     overlie the inferior facet of C4.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Metallic pin with tip at the C5-C6 anterior disk space.
     
     These results were communicated to the operative team following the
     examination.
     
     Additional views have subseqeuntly been added to this clip number.  Whether
     verabl reports were issued for this 2 subsequent views is not known to me. The
     initial view described above is now labelled #1.
     
     On the view labelled #2, a surgical marker overlies the anterior aspect of the
     C2/3 disc space. The C3,C4, and C5 vertebral bodies are now less well seen. It
     is difficult to confirm the position of the posterior fusion device screws in
     relation to the posterior elements, but they appear grossly unchanged.
     
     On the view labelled #3, there is now a strut graft extending caudally from
     the base of the C2 vertebral body, through the levels of C3, C4, C5 and C6--
     the caudal edge of the graft is obscured by overlying structures.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     INDICATION:  67-year-old female with halo status post C2-3 laminectomy for
     metastases of the spine.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**2830-11-10**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the cervical spine without IV contrast was obtained. Coronal
     and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     FINDINGS:  The patient is status post CT laminectomy.  There is a posterior
     fusion device with pedicle screws, which are attached to the occipital bone in
     the midline, as well as C4, C5, and C6.  The appearance is unchanged when
     compared to the prior study.  There is interval resection of anterior
     vertebral bodies of C3, C4, and C5, and placement of pacer device.  There is
     also anterior spinal fusion of this device to the vertebral body of C3.
     Artifact coming from metallic hardware limits evaluation of the spinal canal.
     However, no definite hematoma is seen.  The alignment of the cervical spine is
     within expected range without evidence of anterolisthesis.
     
     There are surgical skin staples overlying the posterior neck in the midline.
     The patient is status post tracheostomy.  There is a large amount of
     secretions of mucus in the trachea above the tracheostomy.  There is a
     nasogastric tube.  Multiple lymph nodes are seen in the neck, which are stable
     when compared to prior study.  The largest one is seen anterior to the carotid
     artery at the level of the thyroid and measures 1.3 cm.  Parotid glands are
     within normal limits.  There is a fluid level in the right maxillary sinus.
     The middle ears and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive postoperative changes as described above.
     Questionable soft tissue density is noted in the right lung apex. A chest
     radiograph is recommended for further evaluation.

     COMPARISON:  Previous study of earlier the same date.
     
     INDICATION:  White blood cell count in sputum.  Question pneumonia.
     
     Lines and tubes are unchanged in position with persistent kinking of the left
     vascular sheath proximal to the skin insertion site.  Cardiac and mediastinal
     contours are stable.  A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is again
     demonstrated.  As noted previously, there are atelectatic changes in the
     middle and lower lung regions adjacent to the effusion, as well as more
     consolidative changes in the right upper lobe, the latter could reflect a
     developing pneumonia given the infectious symptoms.  Overall, compared to the
     previous study of earlier today, there has been slight improved aeration at
     the right lung base with otherwise no significant change allowing for
     technical differences between the two studies.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     PROCEDURE:  Chest CT angiogram.
     
     HISTORY:  67-year-old woman with metastatic endometrial cancer with SOB.
     Evaluate evolution of PE, pulmonary infiltrates and lymph nodes. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT through the thorax with and without contrast,
     angiogram protocol.  Coronal and sagittal reformations are also provided. 
     
     Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2830-11-1**]. 
     
     CHEST CT:  There are new alveolar infiltrates with partial consolidation of
     the right upper lung, apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe, and
     postero-lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe.  There has been no
     interval changes in the nodular cavitary opacities located in the left lower
     lobe, measuring 31 x 26 mm and 20 x 30 mm. The other nodules described
     previously are now obscured by parenquimal consolidations
     Interval increase in size in the right pleural effusion.  
     
     A tracheostomy tube is noted within trachea.
     
     Again demonstrated is extensive lymphadenopathy involving the right
     paratracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and right hiliar region, unchanged from
     the prior study.  There is continued compressive atelectasis of the right
     lower lobe from mass effect.  
     
     The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.
     
     Even though this is a limited study for pulmonary arterial vasculature
     evaluation, due to inyection technique timing, there is no apparent PE
     progression.  
     
     There is esophagogastric tube in place.  
     
     There is a stable liver cyst in the left lobe measuring 24 x 20 mm.  
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no concerning bone lesions.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:   Confirm the findings in the axial images
     
                                                                 (Over)

     FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes including C3-6 corporectomy, allograft
     insertion, and placement of anterior and posterior stabilization hardware are
     again noted.  The degree of prevertebral soft tissue thickening has increased.
     The prevertebral fluid collection extending anteriorly to the right has
     increased in size, although less air is present at this surgical site.  An
     air-fluid level from secretions in the airway is noted above the balloon of
     the tracheostomy tube.  A nasogastric tube is noted.  A fluid level is again
     noted in the right maxillary sinus.  An effusion is visible in the right lung
     apex and associated with atelectasis.  Airspace opacities are noted in both
     lung apices, greater on the right.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Increased prevertebral soft tissue thickening and fluid collection at the
     operative site.
     2.  Large right pleural effusion and airspace opacities in the bilateral lung
     apices.

     COMPARISON:  [**2830-11-15**].
     
     INDICATION:  Soft tissue density in right lung apex on CT of cervical spine. 
     Evaluate right apex.
     
     Comparison is also made to CT C-spine on [**2830-11-15**].  The opacity at the right
     lung apex on the CT of the cervical spine measures fluid attenuation and is
     most suggestive of an area of pleural fluid tracking to the lung apex.
     
     Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place, as well as a left
     subclavian vascular sheath.  Focal kinking of the sheath is noted proximal to
     the skin insertion site.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A
     moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is present with associated
     atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobe.  There is a possible component
     of consolidation in the right upper lobe.  The left lung demonstrates no areas
     of consolidation.  Vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness is noted,
     suggesting a component of fluid overload.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Opacity at right apex on recent CT of the cervical spine likely reflects
     pleural fluid.
     
     2.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with associated atelectatic
     changes in right middle and right lower lobes.  Consolidation in right upper
     lobe, for which infectious pneumonia or aspiration should be considered.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM
     
     CLINICAL DETAILS:  Hypoxia, evaluate for effusions.  
     
     Tracheostomy tube tip lies at least 1.5 cm proximal to the carina. 
     Nasogastric tube tip is not included, but extends to the left upper quadrant. 
     Left subclavian line tip is positioned at the medial subclavian level in the
     region of the midline.  
     
     FINDINGS:  There is opacification of the right hemithorax to the upper zone
     level in keeping with effusion and the previously described concerns of right
     lung consolidation.  
     
     The left hemidiaphragm is visible and no convincing left lung consolidation
     demonstrated.  A minor area of opacity at the lateral left base compared to
     the prior film is noted.
     
     CONCLUSION:
     1.  Relatively stable appearances of the large right-sided
     effusion/consolidation.

     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-24**], 7:49 a.m.
     
     Very large right pleural effusion has decreased in volume and the mediastinum

     AP CHEST 7:28 A.M [**11-27**]
     
     HISTORY:  New hypoxia.  Pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**11-25**] and 15:
     
     Right pleural effusion has increased in volume, now completely obscuring the
     right lung and producing more leftward mediastinal shift.  Heart is unchanged
     in size and probably not appreciably enlarged.  Left lung is grossly clear
     though compromised by the enlarging right pleural effusion.  Tracheostomy tube
     is in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out
     of view.  Findings were discussed with the clinical service caring for this
     patient, at the time of dictation.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      ? change in soft tissue swelling/hematoma in surgical bed

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  67-year-old woman with metastatic endometrial carcinoma status
     post cervical spine surgery with anterior and posterior approach.  Assess for
     change in soft tissue swelling/hematoma in the surgical bed.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast multiplanar MRI of the cervical spine including
     sagittal T1, T2, and STIR, as well as axial gradient and T2.
     
     COMPARISON:  CT neck dated [**2830-11-18**] and CT cervical spine dated [**2830-11-15**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes are again noted.  The posterior stabilization
     hardware from the occiput to C6 is not well assessed due to the associated
     susceptibility artifacts.  C3-5 corpectomies are noted.  Metal hardware has
     been placed anterior to the inferior end of the fibular strut graft.  At the
     inferior plate of C2, there are small osseous fragments, and there is
     associated increased STIR signal within the T2 vertebral body compatible with
     edema.  Note is made of a small amount of fluid interposed between the
     superior end of the fibular strut graft and the inferior end plate of C2.  A
     fluid collection is again noted around corpectomy bed.  Comparison with the
     prior CT examinations is limited, but this collection does not seem any worse
     than in prior studies.  There is no encroachment of the spinal canal at this
     time.  The spinal cord is not compressed.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Extensive postoperative changes, as previously noted and as
     described above.  The fluid collections surrounding the fibular strut graft
     does not appear any worse than on prior studies, but comparison is limited. 
     There does appear to be a small amount of fluid separating the inferior end
     plate of C2 and the superior portion of the graft.

MICU EAST Nursing Progress Note (0700-1900)

Please see carevue for all objective data. Significant events include discussion between husband, daughter, oncology and palliative care nurse ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 92**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 93**]) regarding feasibility of having pt. return home. Heparein gtt dc'ed at 1215 and pt. to OR at 1700 for placement of PEG and right chest tube. 

CNS: Pt. alert, withdrawn but cooperative. It takes much encouragement for her to allow husband to leave the room. He states that she is extremely frightened and views the hospital only as ""a place where she will die"" at this point. Ritalin has been increased...awaiting further psych input regarding question of starting antidepressants. Ativan given x 1 due to anxiety with good effect.

RESP: FIO2 weaned from 80% to 50% high flow neb. Sats have remained in the high 90's. Suctioned q3hr for moderate amounts of thick yellow/blood tinged secretions. Lungs with coarse BS throughout, diminished at the right base.

CVS: Hemodynamically stable with heart rate 80's to 100 ST without VEA. B/P 120-130/syst. 

ID: Afebrile. No change in antibiotic regime. On contact precautions for MRSA and C Diff.

GI: NPO except for meds today in preparation for OR. Abdomen is soft and distended with active bowel sounds throughout. Passing small amounts of soft, brown stool frequently.

F and E: IVF dc'ed due to positive fluid balance. Should be reassessed upon return from OR.

SKIN: Perirectal area markedly excoriated, now oozing BRB. Wound cleanser being used along with double [**Last Name (un) **]/clortrimazole cream to area. Remains on therapeutic bed.

SOCIAL: Husband in all day. Daughter visiting this afternoon. Very concerned about getting pt. home, although husband realizes that a rehab stay would be necessary first. They really seemed to appreciate and be supported by palliative care involvement.

     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Bulky superior mediastinal,
     peritracheal, precarinal, subcarinal, and right hilar lymphadenopathy is again
     demonstrated.  There is external compression produced at right middle lobe and
     right lower lobe bronchi with postobstructive changes.  There is a right-sided
     chest tube that has been placed in the interval.  Multiple ill-defined areas
     of patchy ground-glass opacity are again demonstrated.  There is marked
     interval reduction in the right-sided pleural effusion with trace residual
     effusion on the right and trace left-sided effusion.  Multiple bilateral
     pulmonary nodules, some that demonstrate cavitation are again demonstrated and
     may be consistent with metastases.  A small right-sided pneumothorax is
     demonstrated as well as multiple more focal pockets of air within the pleural
     space on the right.  A left-sided central venous catheter terminates in the
     left brachiocephalic vein.  A tracheostomy tube is again demonstrated.
     
     Limited noncontrast images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a right adrenal
     adenoma and a left-sided hepatic cyst.  There is nonspecific right perinephric
     stranding.
