History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 89 year old woman with CAD s/p IMI in [**2819**], 
PVD, HTN who initially presented to [**Hospital 934**] hospital with left 
sided chest/flank pain. A CT scan without contrast was performed 
which showed a possible intramural thrombus with a 5 cm aneurism 
extending to the left renal vein, with 2 areas of ulceration. 
She continued to have back pain so she was transferred to the 
vascular surgery service at [**Hospital1 83**]. CTA of the abdomen/pelvis 
here with contrast confirmed the findings. CT scan of the chest 
without contrast showed possible extension to the thoracic 
aorta.  
.  
During this admission she developed a different pain in the 
chest, which lasted minutes. Her cardiac enzymes were checked 
which showed CK peak of 468 on [**7-1**] with MB of 41, index 8.8, 
and troponin climbing to 5.15. Her renal function also 
deteriorated during this time, with creatinine from 1.3 to 3.4 
today. She was transferred to cardiology for possible cardiac 
catheterization.  
.  
ROS: Currently, she feels frustrated that she's in the hospital. 
Denies chest pain, flank pain, urinary symptoms. At home she is 
able to perform activities of daily life without difficulty. She 
did have previous chest pain, DOE, occasional SOB, and LE edema. 
All other ROS are negative.  

 
Past Medical History:
PVD, gout, [**Last Name (un) 6292**] esophagus, GERD, atrial fibrillation, 
vetigo, skin squamous cell CA s/p excision, Dyslipidemia, 
Hypertension  
 
Social History:
Social history is significant for previous tobacco use (25 pack 
years). There is no history of alcohol abuse. . 
 
Family History:
Her son had CABG age 50

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 89 yo RHF with ho PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, afib, 
DMII who was admitted aneurysmal dilatation with intramural 
thrombus formation complicated by NSTEMI and now clinical left 
MCA syndrome s/p IV TPA. Patient's event recorded at 11:11 AM 
[**2826-7-5**]. Patient exam prior TPA is significant for left eye gaze 
deviation, right hemianopsia, severe dysarthia, not following 
commands and left arm/face > leg motor weakness. Patient 
received IV TPA at 1:58 pm. Likely etiology of stroke is 
cardioembolic with known Afib and recent MI with known 
hypokinesis/akiniesis in the inferior lateral ventricle (no 
thrombus visualized on TTE) or thrombus visualized in 
intraabdominal aortic aneurysm.  
.
#. Neuro:  There was minimal improvement in exam the morning 
following TPA administration (L gaze deviation, weak withdrawal 
R arm, no speech, does not follow any commands), repeat Head CT 
at 24 hours showed some R cerebellar hemorrhage and hemorrhage 
into infarct.  Results were discussed with family and she was 
subsequently made her CMO.  She was given Ativan PRN anxiety, 
Morphine PRN pain and Scopolamine and Levsin for secretions.  
Palliative care was following.  Patient passed away from 
cardiorespiratory failure on [**2826-7-7**]. 
.
#. NSTEMI with elevated troponin to >5, CK peak at 468 
continuing to trend down. likely unstable plaque. Continue to 
hold on cath until renal failure resolves. currently chest pain 
free.  Continued telemetry.  Continued ASA, plavix, BB (target 
HR 60-70, sbp <130) heparin gtt.  Held ACE given renal failure.
.  
#. Pump EF 40% - Received hydration to improve creatinine.  
Increased BB, held ACEi.
.  
#. Rhythm - NSR, no arrhythmias. monitor by tele  
.  
# Acute renal failure - likely secondary to contrast or prerenal 
etiology. Renal ultrasound showed patent right artery; left 
kidney old and small in size. Cr starting to trend down 
following hydration supporting initial CIN likely exacerbated by 
pre-renal azotemia.  Continued to dose adjust meds.  Needed to 
place foley catheter with regard to urinary retention and renal 
failure.
.
#. AAA with intramural thrombus - stable per vascular surgery. 
No plans for OR at this time. Heparin OK.  Appreciated vascular 
recs.  
.  
# Bladder spasm - likely related to UTI given spasm, dysuria, 
and +UA. had 3 days of cipro with no significant improvement in 
symptoms. Given baseline urinary dysmotility and retention, 
would prefer to treat as ""complicated"" UTI and use 7 days of 
therapy. the current symptoms appear acute worsening of her 
chronic urinary problems.  No growth on multiple UCxs.  Treated 
with empiric cipro x 7 days.  Needed foley as above.
.  
#. FEN - PO, low salt diet  
.  
#. Access: PIV  
.  
#. PPx: heparin GTT, PPI, bowel regimen

     EXAMINATION:  CTA of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast, [**2826-6-24**].
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     INDICATION:  89-year-old woman with aortic dissection. 
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial imaging was obtained through the abdomen and pelvis before
     and after the administration of IV contrast.  Images were reformatted in the
     coronal and sagittal planes as well as three dimensionally.
     
     FINDINGS FOR CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Limited imaging
     of the lung bases demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis.  There are coronary
     artery calcifications.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  There is
     a small hiatal hernia.  The lower thoracic aorta is tortuous and demonstrates
     a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer along its left lateral wall, this ulcer
     measures approximately 2.8 cm in craniocaudal extent x 1.4 cm in transverse
     dimension.  Second smaller penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer is demonstrated
     just inferiorly in the thoracic aorta.  The thoracic aorta is aneurysmal,
     measuring 4.9 cm x 4 cm in maximum dimension.  Irregular mural thrombus is
     demonstrated.
     
     The aorta at the level of the hiatus measures 4.3 cm x 4 cm and demonstrates
     irregular mural thrombus.  There is severe stenosis involving the celiac axis
     which opacifies distally.  There is moderate stenosis involving the SMA with
     irregular mural thrombus involving the most proximal SMA.  The abdominal
     aortic aneurysm continues from the chest and extends through the abdomen to
     the level of the aortic bifurcation, the maximum dimensions infrarenally are
     4.7 cm x 5.2 cm.  At the level of the renal arteries, the aorta measures 4.6
     cm x 4.4 cm.  There is mild narrowing of the right renal artery which
     bifurcates early.  The left kidney is atrophic.  At the lower pole of the
     right kidney, there is a 3-cm low-density lesion consistent with cyst.
     Multiple low-density lesions are demonstrated within the atrophic left kidney,
     also likely cysts.  The subcentimeter lesions are too small to characterize.
     There is no opacification of the left renal artery.  The liver, spleen,
     pancreas, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.  Calcified gallstones are
     demonstrated within the gallbladder.  There is a 2.6 cm x 1.3 cm left adrenal
     mass which is not definitely consistent with adenoma, however, may represent a
     lipid-poor adenoma and is not completely characterized on this examination.
     Multiple small periportal lymph nodes are demonstrated, none of which are
                                                                 (Over)

     pathologically enlarged.  The bowel is normal in caliber.  Numerous
     retroperitoneal lymph nodes are demonstrated, none of which are pathologically
     enlarged by CT criteria.  Multiple calcified mesenteric lymph nodes are
     demonstrated, likely from prior granulomatous infection.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The common iliac arteries are
     tortuous, however, are normal in size.  There is moderate stenosis of the left
     common iliac artery.  The right internal iliac artery is tortuous.  There is
     extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The
     uterus and adnexal structures are unremarkable.  A Foley balloon catheter is
     seen inflated within the bladder and gas is seen within the bladder, likely
     from catheterization.  There is no ascites, lymphadenopathy, or free
     intraperitoneal gas.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or cystic lesions.  The bones are
     diffusely osteopenia.  There is degenerative disease of the lower thoracic and
     lumbar spine.  There is an age-indeterminate compression fracture deformity of
     the superior endplate of L2.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Lower thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm, maximum dimensions of the
     abdominal aorta measure 5.2 cm x 4.7 cm.  The aneurysm extends from the
     thoracic aorta down into the abdominal aorta, further evaluation with CTA of
     the chest is recommended to fully better evaluate the thoracic aorta.
     Extensive irregular mural thrombus is demonstrated in the inferior thoracic
     and abdominal aorta.
     
     2.  Two penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers involving the lower thoracic aorta.
     
     3.  Severe proximal celiac stenosis and mild SMA stenosis.
     
     4.  Mild narrowing of the renal artery.
     
     5.  Cholelithiasis.
     
     6.  Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.

     HISTORY:  89-year-old woman with chest pain.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector axial images of the chest were obtained without
     intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2826-6-24**] Abdomen CT.
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a dumbell shaped, fusiform
     thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm extending from the mid descending aorta into
     the upper abdomen, partially evaluated by the contrast-enhanced Abdomen CT on
     [**6-24**]. Proximal to the level of the dissected and/or ulcerated portion of the
     abdomen in the low chest demonstrated on the Abdomen CT, the 3.5cm long, upper
     component of the aneurysm has a maximum diameter of 47mm approximately 15mm
     below the level of the carina (2:24, 25).
     
     Just above the carina, separation of intimal calcification from the posterior
     wall suggests dissection, also seen in the normal caliber ascending aorta at
     the levels of the left coronary orifice (2:29) and intrapericardial right
     pulmonary artery (2:24). There is no periaortic hematoma or pericardial fluid
     collection.
     
     The pulmonary arteries are at the upper limits of normal in diameter. Coronary
     artery calcifications and possible right coronary stents are noted.
     Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm in short axis diameter.  Several,
     2-3mm wide right upper lobe pulmonary nodules are noted. There is mild
     emphysema. Dependent atelectasis is identified.  There is a small
     calcification at the left lung base.  A small axial hiatal hernia is
     identified.  Imaged portions of the upper abdomen are otherwise unremarkable.
     There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1.  Bilobed thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.7 cm in the mid
     chest.  Multiple areas of elevated intimal calcification raise concern for at
     least a Type B and possibly Type A dissection.  Further evaluation with non-
     enhanced MRI is recommended because of renal insufficiency.
     2.  Several sub 2-3 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodules.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATIONS:  Known abdominal aortic aneurysm with increasing severe
     paraspinous pain.  Assess for change in aortic size.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric CT imaging was performed without oral or IV contrast
     from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest CT from two days earlier.  Abdominal CT from four days
     earlier.
     
     CHEST CT:  The aorta is unchanged in appearance with ectasia of the arch and
     descending thoracic aorta with areas of mural calcification.  No new
     periaortic hematoma is identified.  Intraluminal detail cannot be assessed on
     this study if there is clinical concern for dissection.  There is emphysema
     and areas of bilateral pleural thickening with calcification, left greater
     than right.  Appearance of lungs is unchanged without new consolidations or
     pleural/pericardial effusion.  There is a likely small hiatal hernia.
     
     ABDOMEN CT:  There is diffuse ectasia of the abdominal aorta, measuring up to
     5.0 x 4.6 cm at the level of the left renal vein, which is unchanged since the
     prior abdominal CT allowing for differences in technique.  No areas of acute
     inflammatory stranding are identified in the abdomen.  As before there is
     calcified mural plaque at the site of a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in
     the suprarenal aorta, unchanged in position compared to the previous study.
     There is cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. There is
     gallbladder distension.  The left kidney is atrophic.  There are multiple
     likely cysts, which are incompletely assessed without IV contrast. Left
     adrenal mass (2.6 x 1.3cm) is unchanged in appearance is not further
     characterized on the current study. There is no free intraperitoneal air.
     Noncontrast assessment of the liver and spleen is unremarkable. Calcified
     mesenteric lymph nodes are redemonstrated. There is diffuse colonic
     diverticulosis.
     
     Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the spine.  There is
     exaggeration of the thoracic kyphosis.  Compression deformity of L2 is
     unchanged since [**6-24**], the most remote comparison study available.
     Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are again seen.

     INDICATION:  Aortic aneurysm with acute on chronic renal failure.  Assess

     FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 12.1 cm in maximum length with relatively
     preserved renal cortical thickness.  Simple cyst is seen in the mid pole of
     the right kidney measuring 3.7 x 2.6 x 3.4 cm.  There is good flow within the
     right kidney.  There is a normal arterial waveform with normal systolic and
     diastolic flow.  The resistive index varies from 0.76 to 0.78.  Normal venous
     flow is seen within the right kidney.
     
     The left kidney is markedly reduced in size at 6 cm.  Comparison is made with
     the previous CT from [**6-8**] which shows an atrophic left kidney.  Several
     scattered simple cysts are seen in relation to the left kidney.  No
     significant arterial or venous flow could be identified. This is consistent
     with the atherosclerotic nature of the left renal artery as identified on the
     previous CT.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable right kidney with normal blood flow, with atrophic
     left kidney consistent with previous recent CT.

Data:
89yo woman with a h/o PVD, HTN, Afib, DMII who was admitted for NSTEMI and was ready to be discharged to rehab from the floor when she walked to use the commode and became acutely weak on the left side, slurred speech and was brought back to her bed and code stroke was called at 1111. She was admitted to the SICU at 1330. She was very agitated with garbled speech, unable to make out any words. Moving right leg in bed very slightly, gross movement only when stimulated right upper extremity, lifting and holding left extremities, left sided facial droop and would not follow commands. Pupils equal and reactive at 3mm with a left sided gaze. Tongue deviating to left. Foley placed and PIVx2 inserted and TPA was given at 1358. Monitoring per protocol. Labetolol ivp prn for Bp>180. Post TPA neuro status slightly improved. Patient purposefully lifting and holding right leg in bed and moving right arm in bed. Does not follow commands and continues to be agitated. Family states she did stick out her tongue to command for them. She appears to track at times. Continues with garbled speech. Family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8463**] from neurology and the with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1576**] to discuss plan of care. Family all present and decided to make pt. DNR but continued treatment.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  89-year-old female with left MCA stroke, status post IV TPA.  Assess
     for intracranial hemorrhage.
     
     Comparison is made to prior MRI dated [**2826-7-5**].
     
     NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There has been interval development of hyperattenuating material extending
     within the right cerebellum suspicious for new hemorrhage.  Additional
     hyperattenuating areas are noted along the sulci within the right parietal and
     temporal lobes (2A:18, 20) which are suspicious for small areas of petechial
     hemorrhage.  There has been evolution of the known left MCA stroke with
     increased cytotoxic edema and mild 4 mm rightward subfalcine shift. Areas of
     hyperattenuation within the stroke distribution may represent areas of small
     spared cortex or petechial hemorrhage.  No new infarcts are identified and
     there is stable appearance to a lacunar infarct involving the right caudate.
     No evidence of hydrocephalus or intraventricular hemorrhage. Osseous
     structures and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Limited examination due to motion with new right cerebellar hemmorhage and
     suspicious areas of hyperattenuating material along the sulci within the right
     parietal and temporal lobes suspicious for new petechial hemorrhage.
     
     2. Evolving left MCA distribution stroke with increased surrounding edema and
     a 4 mm rightward subfalcine shift.  Either areas of spared left cortex or
     areas of left cortical hemmorhage.
     
     Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10465**] on date of exam at approximately 11 a.m.
