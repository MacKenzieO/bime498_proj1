Admission Date:  [**3357-7-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**3357-8-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**3274-8-26**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Acove

Addendum:  This patient died while in the hospital and this
addendum is to be added to the discharge summary that was
done on [**3357-7-30**].

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  The patient's calcium continued
to rise.  On [**8-1**], it was a level of 12.1.  The patient was
restarted fluids and Lasix and calcitonin, as well as weekly
pamidronate.  The patient's urine culture was positive for
[**Female First Name (un) 434**] and Diflucan was started.  At this time, the white
blood cell count was 14.7.  At this time, the patient was
eating a soft diet in addition to his tube feed.  On [**8-3**],
the prednisone was added to the patient's medications because
of persistent hypercalcemia.  The calcium eventually
decreased to about 10.6 at which point it began to rise
again.  Repeat urine culture after treatment for the fungal
urinary tract infection was still positive for [**Female First Name (un) 434**], so
the patient received a 24 hour amphotericin-B bladder washing
x1 day.  Repeat urine culture was negative for [**Female First Name (un) 434**], but
positive for Enterobacter, so the patient was started on
levofloxacin.  At this point, the patient's calcium had risen
to over 12 and intravenous fluids and Lasix were markedly
increased to try to control the calcium.  Despite these
measures, the calcium continued to rise.  On [**8-15**], it was
noted that the patient was having [**Last Name (un) 3743**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3744**] respirations
and on [**8-16**] the patient received a Rituxan treatment on the
oncology floor.  He also received a therapeutic thoracentesis
later that day for significant left pleural effusion.  Blood
glucose was controlled during hospital with bid NPH and the
patient eventually stopped taking po food and was only tube
fed.  With the fluid treatment for hypercalcemia, the patient
also had problems with elevated sodium, so free water through
his G-tube was used to control this.  This was around [**8-18**].  At this time, the patient became less and less
responsive everyday until he was virtually unarousable.
The family agreed to stop the intravenous fluids had the
Lasix.  The patient also over the last few weeks had been
gradually developing left lower extremity swelling in
addition to the right lower extremity.  Eventually, the
patient was made comfort measures only.  This included
scopolamine patches to try to dry up the patient's
secretions.  Levsin was also used for this purposes.
Increasing doses of morphine were used to ensure the patient
was comfortable.  On Saturday, [**3357-8-20**] at approximately 3:30
p.m., Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 187**] pronounced Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6914**] dead.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Elderly confused male with fever.
     
     SINGLE VIEW OF CHEST:  There are no previous exams for comparison.  There is a
     dense consolidation versus collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula.  There
     may be an associated left pleural effusion causing an increased haziness of
     the entire left lung zone.  There is no evidence of right-sided infiltrates or
     effusions.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited.  Note that the
     patient is somewhat rotated on this exam.  The soft tissues and osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Dense consolidation of the left lower lobe and lingula,
     suggestive of pneumonia. It is difficult to exclude a parapneumonic effusion
     on this single projection.
     Follow-up PA and lateral CXR are recommended to ensure complete resolution
     following appropriate antibiotic therapy.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     
     INDICATION:  Non-Hodgkins' lymphoma.  Chest x-ray at outside hospital
     demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia vs pleural effusion.  Fever and
     neutropenia.
     
     Helical CT of the thorax was performed without Iv or oral contrast.  Images
     were obtained with 5 mm collimation and reconstructed at 5 mm intervals
     throughout the thorax.
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  Soft tissues of the thorax demonstrate large, layering
     left pleural effusion.  Note is also made of thoracic lymph node enlargement
     including an AP window lymph node measuring 1.4 cm in greatest short axis
     dimension and a lower right paratracheal node measuring 9 mm in greatest short
     axis dimension.  Note is also made of a rounded soft tissue density in the
     left hila region, suggesting left hilar lymph node enlargement as well.
     Additionally, there are lymph nodes in the subcarinal region.  The heart is
     upper limits of normal in size.  There is a small pericardial effusion
     present.  There is a trace right pleural effusion.
     Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates pneumobilia.  The
     adrenal glands are within normal limits.  The spleen appears enlarged.  The
     attenuation of the spleen appears heterogeneous with apparent area of low
     attenuation posteriorly.  There is also a small hypodensity near the dome of
     the spleen.  The adrenal glands and imaged portions of the kidneys and spleen
     are unremarkable but these organs are incompletely imaged on  this study.
     Vascular calcifications are noted.
     
     Assessement of the lungs is somewhat limited due to extensive respiratory
     motion.  There is passive atelectasis of the left lower lobe adjacent to the
     large effusion.  There are also lesser degrees of atelectasis within the
     lingula and left upper lobe, also likely related to the large effusion. Linear
     atelectasis is seen in the right upper lobe vs focal scarring.  Within the
     right middle and right lower lobes, there are areas of ground glass
     opacification and possible areas of early developing consolidation at the
     right base. There is also a focal round opacity with ill defined margins in
     the lingula.  No obstructing endobronchial lesions are identified, but
     assessment of the airways is limited by extensive respiratory motion.
     
     Skeletal structures demonstrate evidence of previous median sternotomy
     procedure.  Degenerative changes are seen within the spine.
     
     Note is also made of right IJ central venous catheter terminating within the
     superior vena cava.
                                                                 (Over)

     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Large dependent left pleural effusion with associated passive atelectasis
     of the left lower lobe.  This likely accounts for the observed finding noted
     on outside chest radiograph.
     2)  Intrathoracic lymph node enlargement, most prominent within the aortico-
     pulmonary window and left hilar regions, but also involving other nodal
     stations.  This  may be due to the history of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
     3)  Enlarged, heterogeneous spleen, incompletely imaged on this study.
     Correlation with outside studies, if available, would be helpful.  In the
     absence of outside studies, consider further evaluation with ultrasound.  This
     may be due to patient's history of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
     4)  Small pericardial effusion.
     5)  Ground glass opacity and patchy consolidation predominantly in right lower
     lobe, but also involving a small portion of the right middle lobe. This may be
     due to pulmonary infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
     6)  Focal rounded lingular opacity, likely infecious/inflammatory, but
     consider a follow-up chest CT in 3 months duration to ensure complete
     resolution and to fully exclude a neoplasm at this site.

     INDICATION: New dementia/delirium secondary to hypercalcemia due to non-
     Hodgkin's lymphoma. G-tube previously placed by surgery at outside hospital
     approximately one month ago, by report from primary house staff, pulled out
     approximately one week prior to admission, and replaced with Foley catheter.
     Now leaking around Foley catheter with vomiting overnight.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Procedure performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1562**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 294**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], Staff Radiologist, was present for the whole procedure.
     
     CONTRAST AND MEDICATIONS: 70 cc of ionic contrast (Conray 60%) administered
     via gastric Foley catheter and G-J tube. 3 cc 1% Lidocaine administered
     subcutaneously.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: Patient's daughter is informed of the details and
     associated risks of the procedure and witnessed telephone consent is obtained.
     Patient is placed supine on angiographic table and abdomen is sterilely
     prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance attempts were made to pass an 0.035 Glidewire, a 5
     French Cobra C2 catheter and an 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff wire through the
     Foley catheter into the pylorus, but those were unsuccessful.
     The Foley catheter was then removed over an Amplatz wire and exchanged for a 7
     French 23 cm-long sheath. A 5 French SOS catheter is advanced over a 0.035
     glide wire such that the tip is within the distal duodenum.  The glide wire is
     exchanged for a 0.035 soft- tip Amplatz wire with tip in the proximal jejunum.
     SOS catheter is then exchanged for the 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 205**] GJ tube such that the
     tip is within the proximal jejunum and the pigtail loop is formed within the
     small bowel. Contrast injected via the GJ tube demonstrates the tip to be
     within the proximal jejunum and abdominal radiograph is obtained to confirm
     position. The GJ tube is affixed to the skin with 0-Prolene. The tube is ready
     for use. There are no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.

     INDICATION: New dementia/delirium secondary to hypercalcemia due to non-
     Hodgkin's lymphoma. G-tube previously placed by surgery at outside hospital
     approximately one month ago, by report from primary house staff, pulled out
     approximately one week prior to admission, and replaced with Foley catheter.
     Now leaking around Foley catheter with vomiting overnight.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Procedure performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1562**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 294**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 294**]
     [**Name (STitle) 295**], Staff Radiologist, was present for the whole procedure.
     
     CONTRAST AND MEDICATIONS: 70 cc of ionic contrast (Conray 60%) administered
     via gastric Foley catheter and G-J tube. 3 cc 1% Lidocaine administered
     subcutaneously.
     
     PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: Patient's daughter is informed of the details and
     associated risks of the procedure and witnessed telephone consent is obtained.
     Patient is placed supine on angiographic table and abdomen is sterilely
     prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance attempts were made to pass an 0.035 Glidewire, a 5
     French Cobra C2 catheter and an 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff wire through the
     Foley catheter into the pylorus, but those were unsuccessful.
     The Foley catheter was then removed over an Amplatz wire and exchanged for a 7
     French 23 cm-long sheath. A 5 French SOS catheter is advanced over a 0.035
     glide wire such that the tip is within the distal duodenum.  The glide wire is
     exchanged for a 0.035 soft- tip Amplatz wire with tip in the proximal jejunum.
     SOS catheter is then exchanged for the 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 205**] GJ tube such that the
     tip is within the proximal jejunum and the pigtail loop is formed within the
     small bowel. Contrast injected via the GJ tube demonstrates the tip to be
     within the proximal jejunum and abdominal radiograph is obtained to confirm
     position. The GJ tube is affixed to the skin with 0-Prolene. The tube is ready
     for use. There are no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the
     procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful exchange of percutaneous gastric Foley catheter for 14
     French [**Doctor Last Name 205**] GJ tube with the tip within the proximal jejunum and ready for
     use.
                                                                 (Over)

     INDICATION: Inability to flush percutaneous gastrojejunostomy (G-J) tube.
     Recent chest X- ray demonstrated a kink in the distal portion of the tube.
     This is an 82 y/o gentleman with dementia.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 3514**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 294**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'Othee. The attenting radiologist, Dr.
     [**Last Name (STitle) 294**] [**Name (STitle) 295**], was present and supervised the procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE: With the patient supine on the table, the anterior abdomen and
     protruding portion of the GJ tube were prepped in sterile fashion. A static
     fluorographic image showed the kink in the distal portion of the G-J tube. A
     0.035 stiff Amplatz wire was extended down the lumen of the tube and the pig-
     tail forming string was cut and the tube given a twist so as to uncoil the
     pigtail. The wire was passed up to the previously noted kink, at which point
     the G-J tube was slowly withdrawn over the wire. The end of the wire remained
     in the jejunum, as demonstrated on fluoroscopy.
     A new 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 205**] G-J tube was then passed over the wire into the
     stomach, duodenum, and proximal small bowel, all of which was observed
     fluoroscopically. The wire was then withdrawn and the locking loop deployed by
     pulling back on this string and giving the tube a small twist. The external
     portion of the tube was affixed to the skin with an 0-prolene suture after
     injection of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A FlexiTract was applied as
     well. Confirmation of position was obtained with a static fluoroscopic image
     of the abdomen after injection of 20 ml of Conray 60% into the tube. Small
     bowel mucosal folds were outlined by this contrast and no extravasation was
     seen.
     
     COMPLICATIONS: The patient the procedure satisfactorily and there were no
     complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of kinked G-J tube with a new 14 French
     [**Doctor Last Name 205**] G-J tube. The tube is ready for use.

     because of the significant left sided pleural effusion.  This is not
     significantly changed in comparison to the previous study.  There is a lucency
     seen in the apex suggesting aerated lungs.  There is also a small right sided
     pleural effusion, as well.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The left main stem
     bronchus is not identified, of uncertain clinical significance.  A gastric
     tube is also identified.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Stable chest radiograph with large left sided pleural effusion with evidence
     of aeration of the upper lobes and a small right sided pleural effusion.  Ther
     is no pneumothorax.

     Chest single AP film.
     
     History of thoracentesis for left pleural effusion.  Evaluate for
     pneumothorax.
     
     Status post thoracentesis.  There is a persistent large left pleural effusion.
      No pneumothorax.  Status post CABG.  Cannot evaluate heart size due to
     effusion but there is obvious cardiomegaly.  J tube overlies mid abdomen.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old man with above
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Dilated bowel loops?
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Abdominal distention.
     
     A tube overlies upper abdomen.  A gas filled loop of bowel is present in the
     central abdomen.  It is uncertain if this is small bowel.  Gas is present
     throughout the colon and there is no evidence for intestinal obstruction.
     Surgical clips are present in the left upper quadrant.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     One loop of possibly dilated small bowel in upper central abdomen, but no
     evidence for intestinal obstruction.  Correlate clinically and with follow up
     or contrast study by J-tube if indicated as no relevant clinical information
     is available.
