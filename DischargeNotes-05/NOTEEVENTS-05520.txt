     TECHNIQUE: non-contrast images through the brain.
     
     No prior studies for comparison.
     
     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  There is no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is
     encephalomalacia within the distribution of a prior MCA infarction.  There is
     preservation of the [**Doctor Last Name 20**]/white matter junction.  There is no hydronephrosis.
     There is no shift of the normally midline structures.  There are
     calcifications of the intracavernous carotid arteries.  There is some
     thickening of the ethmoid air cells and nasal passageways.  This could be due
     to patient's intubation.  No skull fracture is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Evidence of old right MCA infarct.  No evidence of acute infarct.
      No intracranial hemorrhage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Respiratory decompensation with lactic acidosis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired images were obtained from lung apices to the
     pubic symphysis without iv contrast.
     
     There is no prior study for comparison.
     
     CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: There are no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymph
     nodes.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The et tube terminates at the
     carina and headed towards to right main stem bronchus and could be pulled back
     several cm.  There is some atelectasis and small effusions within the lungs,
     but no air-space consolidation.
     
     CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  Some ascites is seen around the liver.  There is
     portal venous air.  Punctate foci of air are seen within the mesentety
     probably within vessels.  There is ""fecalization"" of the proximal jejunum with
     some surrounding mesenteric air. There is excessive stranding within the
     lesser sac tracking into the root of the mesentery. Fluid is seen tracking
     laterally in the left anterior pararenal space. The gallbladder is distended.
     The wall does not appear thickened. There is a radiopaque gallstone.
     
     CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is non- specific stranding surrounding
     both kidneys. There is no hydronephrosis. A small amount of air is seen within
     the right common femoral vein, likely from attempted line placement. There are
     no enlarged intraadominal or pelvic lymph nodes. Degenerative changes are seen
     in the spine, but there are no suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Portal venous air, thickening and fecalization of the proximal jejunum.  This
     indicates necrotic bowel, probably jejunum. There is extensive inflammation in
     the root of the mesentery.  The bowel is collapsed no focal thickening is
     identified.

     opacity in the left lower lung zone, but the diaphragm is still visualized and

The pt was made CMO after a team discussion c the pts health care proxy ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 288**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 289**]) and the pts PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 290**] these conversations it was determined that the pt would not want to be kept alive via aggressive life support in which a meaningful recovery was negliable.  CT scan results revealed necrotic bowel which required emergent surgery, unfortunately the pt was not a surgical candidate.  Pt had been profoundly acidemic since admit, fluid overloaded c two pressors in place.  A Catholic priest was paged and visited the pt c the health care proxy @ the BS to give last rites/sacrament of the sick.  The pt was subsequently extubated @ 13:55 c both Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt's in place for comfort/sedation.  At 14:05 the pt became asystolic and expired.  The team was notified.  The team has contacted the health care proxy/PCP to inform them of the pt outcome.  Please see CareVue and the pts blue chart for additional nursing/pt care data.  The pt is wearing a ring on her L index finger -- gold band c three blue stones noted.  Additional personal affects will accompany the pt down to the mourge and consists of: upper dentures, underwear, housecoat, slippers.
