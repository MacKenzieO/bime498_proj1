ESOPHAGUS

Reason: R/O esophageal perforation, use thin barium 
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
R/O esophageal perforation, use thin barium 
HISTORY: 81-year-old male with probable infected aortic 
hematoma. Evaluate for esophageal perforation.

Comparison is made to prior CT examination dated earlier on same 
day.

ESOPHAGRAM.

Multiple thin sips of Optiray contrast was administered followed 
by thin barium. No abnormal extravasation of contrast is noted 
outside of the esophageal lumen, which displayed normal primary 
peristaltic contractions and diffuse tertiary contractions. No 
evidence of hiatal hernia or reflux is noted on this limited 
exam. Contrast and thin barium was noted to pass freely through 
the esophagus into the stomach.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of esophageal perforation.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

Reason: please characterize aorta 
Field of view: 36 Contrast: VISAPAQUE

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with known AAA and ? thoracic hematoma 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please characterize aorta 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 81-year-old with known AAA and chest pain radiating 
to the back, evaluate for dissection.

COMPARISONS: None.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
with and without 90 cc of nonionic Visipaque contrast. Please 
note that despite the patient's elevated creatinine of 2.6, the 
ED and the covering vascular surgery team thought that the study 
with emergent enough to rule out a type A dissection for which 
contrast was warranted. The risks and benefits were discussed 
with the patient prior to the study.

CT VASCULAR: On the non-contrast images, there is an extensive 
type B aortic intramural hematoma, extending from the takeoff of 
the left subclavian artery, to just proximal to the celiac axis. 
There is a tiny linear area of non- enhancement involving the 
arch distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian, which could 
represent a very early dissection flap. There is a large 
penetrating ulcer involving the proxiaml descending thoracic 
aorta. Additionally, there is a large amount of air within the 
aortic wall at this level and also at several other locations in 
the abdominal aorta. Specifically, there is prominent air 
involving the posterior aortic wall just inferior to the renal 
artery takeoff. another focus involving the anterior aortic wall 
just inferior to this. Finally, there is air seen within the 
proximal right common iliac artery. Note is made of stenosis at 
the celiac artery origin. The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 613**] are widely patent.

CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural 
effusions and atelectasis. The heart, pericardium, and great 
vessels are unremarkable. There is no evidence of hematoma 
within the mediastinum nor pericardium. There is trace coronary 
artery calcification. This nongated study does not provide 
optimal evaluation of the coronary arteries. The pulmonary 
arteries enhance normally.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Hypodense lesion in segment III of 
the liver anteriorly, likely a cyst or hemangioma but not fully 
characterized. Small hyperenhancing lesion in segment VII. There 
is left-sided intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mild 
prominence of the extrahepatic common duct. The native kidneys 
are minimally atrophic. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, 
stomach, and proximal bowel are unremarkable.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: No acute abnormalities are seen in 
the pelvis. There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias. 
Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates only diffuse 
degenerative changes.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images 
confirm the above findings. There is diffuse atherosclerotic 
disease throughout the abdominal aorta. There is a large 
infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to 5 cm in sagittal AP 
dimension.

IMPRESSION: 
1) Extensive type B aortic intramural hematoma, extending from 
the origin of the left subclavian artery to the upper abdominal 
aorta. No definite aortic dissection, however, there is a tiny 
linear hypodensity involving the mid aortic arch medially, which 
may be the very beginning of an aortic dissection flap.
2) Multiple foci of air within the aortic wall, highly 
suspicious for multifocal mycotic aneurysms, the most prominent 
in the proximal descending aorta adjacent to the large 
pseudoaneurysm/penetrating ulcer, likely the origin of the 
patient's intramural hematoma.
3) No colonic lesion or evidence of diverticulitis to account 
for the aortic wall air, though colonoscopy may be considered 
after the patient is stabilized.
4) 5-cm infrarenal aortic abdominal aneurysm.
5) Moderate left-sided intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
6) Hyperenhancing segment VII and hypodense segment III hepatic 
lesions, not fully characterized on this study, the former could 
be further assessed by MRI.

Findings were discussed immediately after the study with the 
covering cardiothoracic surgery fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6947**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to CSRU from ER on [**3-28**] early AM and re-scanned 
urgently. Results showed the infrerenal AAA as well as a Type B 
intramural hematoma. Also noted were multiple foci of intramural 
air consistent with a possible mycotic process, and a 
penetrating ulcer of the thoracic aorta ( please see above 
results of study). ID consult requested and pt. started on 
triple antibiotic therapy with blood cultures and RPR sent. 
Thoracic and vascular surgery also consulted as well as Dr. 
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from CT surgery. Not a candidate for open repair of TAA 
per vascular, but endo stent-grafting would be considered if 
aorta further dilates of symptoms worsened. General surgery also 
evaluated patient, with no change in plan for abx therapy and BP 
control. Gram positive rods grew from blood cultures with 
diagnosis of clostridium aortitis. Barium swallow did not reveal 
any fistula.

High-risk surgery was discussed with the pt. and his family. 
They refused surgery and opted for medical therapy. The pt. also 
declined possible intubation and requested he not be 
resuscitated. Pt. requested comfort measures only. PICC line 
placed for continued abx therapy. Transferred to the floor on 
[**3-29**]. Fentanyl patch and morphine continued for pain/palliative 
care. BS coarse throughout on [**3-31**] with increasing somnolence. 
Throughout the night, he became more hypotensive and 
unresponsive to fluid therapy.
He did not appear to be in distress. At 5AM, he had cessation of 
pulse, heart sounds and respirations. He was pronounced expired 
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 70**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

     anteriorly, likely a cyst or hemangioma but not fully characterized. Small
     hyperenhancing lesion in segment VII. There is left-sided intrahepatic biliary
     ductal dilatation and mild prominence of the extrahepatic common duct. The
     native kidneys are minimally atrophic. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands,
     stomach, and proximal bowel are unremarkable.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  No acute abnormalities are seen in the pelvis.
     There are bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.  Evaluation of the
     osseous structures demonstrates only diffuse degenerative changes.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the
     above findings.  There is diffuse atherosclerotic disease throughout the
     abdominal aorta.  There is a large infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to
     5 cm in sagittal AP dimension.
     
     IMPRESSION: 
     1) Extensive type B aortic intramural hematoma, extending from the origin of
     the left subclavian artery to the upper abdominal aorta.  No definite aortic
     dissection, however, there is a tiny linear hypodensity involving the mid
     aortic arch medially, which may be the very beginning of an aortic dissection
     flap.
     2) Multiple foci of air within the aortic wall, highly suspicious for
     multifocal mycotic aneurysms, the most prominent in the proximal descending
     aorta adjacent to the large pseudoaneurysm/penetrating ulcer, likely the
     origin of the patient's intramural hematoma.
     3) No colonic lesion or evidence of diverticulitis to account for the aortic
     wall air, though colonoscopy may be considered after the patient is
     stabilized.
     4) 5-cm infrarenal aortic abdominal aneurysm.
     5) Moderate left-sided intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
     6) Hyperenhancing segment VII and hypodense segment III hepatic lesions, not
     fully characterized on this study, the former could be further assessed by
     MRI.
     
     Findings were discussed immediately after the study with the covering

      Extensive type B aortic intramural hematoma, with a probable very early
      dissection flap in the arch, not extending proximal the left subclavian. Large
      penetrating ulcer in descending aorta. Scattered air in the aortic wall of
      unclear significance but raising the concern for infection.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  81-year-old with known AAA and chest pain radiating to the back,
     evaluate for dissection.
     
     COMPARISONS:  None.
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and
     without 90 cc of nonionic Visipaque contrast.  Please note that despite the
     patient's elevated creatinine of 2.6, the ED and the covering vascular surgery
     team thought that the study with emergent enough to rule out a type A
     dissection for which contrast was warranted.  The risks and benefits were
     discussed with the patient prior to the study.
     
     CT VASCULAR:  On the non-contrast images, there is an extensive type B aortic
     intramural hematoma, extending from the takeoff of the left subclavian artery,
     to just proximal to the celiac axis. There is a tiny linear area of non-
     enhancement involving the arch distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian,
     which could represent a very early dissection flap. There is a large
     penetrating ulcer involving the proxiaml descending thoracic aorta.
     Additionally, there is a large amount of air within the aortic wall at this
     level and also at several other locations in the abdominal aorta.
     Specifically, there is prominent air involving the posterior aortic wall just
     inferior to the renal artery takeoff. another focus involving the anterior
     aortic wall just inferior to this. Finally, there is air seen within the
     proximal right common iliac artery. Note is made of stenosis at the celiac
     artery origin. The SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent.
     
     CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
     atelectasis.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.
     There is no evidence of hematoma within the mediastinum nor pericardium. There
     is trace coronary artery calcification.  This nongated study does not provide
     optimal evaluation of the coronary arteries.  The pulmonary arteries enhance
     normally.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Hypodense lesion in segment III of the liver
                                                                 (Over)
