Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST
Interval development of multiple predominantly upper lobe, 
poorly defined 
nodules, some of which demonstrate central lucency, possibly 
reflecting 
cavitation or a bronchogram given motion artifact. The 
differential diagnosis 
includes invasive Aspergillus, nocardia, and septic emboli. 
Striking, diffuse, bilateral dependent areas of ground glass 
opacity which 
spare the anterior/nondependent portions of the lungs and are 
associated with 
bronchial dilation. The distribution is suggestive of ARDS, 
which may 
complicate infection. Diffuse atypical infection and drug 
toxicity are also in 
the differential diagnosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was treated in the ICU for difficulty maintaining adequate 
oxygen saturation.  Pt's family chose to make patient DNR/DNI 
but to continue antibiotic treatment of pneumonia and blood 
product support.  He was transferred to BMT service where his
