Admission Date: [**3128-5-6**]        Discharge Date: [**3128-5-10**]

Date of Birth:  [**3042-5-25**]        Sex:  F

Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 85-year-old female with
osteoporosis and legally blind who fell while walking with
family in a mall.  She had no precipitating symptoms, no head
trauma or seizure activity but did lose consciousness for
approximately 2 minutes.  After the syncopal episode, she
felt lightheaded and had a headache; 30 minutes later, she
had a second syncopal episode.  The patient became
progressively agitated and confused over the next few hours.
The patient was in [**Country 6597**] and refused to go to the emergency
room.  They drove down from [**Country 6597**] to [**Hospital1 83**] Emergency
Department for evaluation.  On arrival to the emergency
department, her vital signs were stable, but she quickly
became hypoxic and hypotensive requiring intubation and
pressors.  A head CT showed an old right occipital infarct,
and she had a negative CTA and negative lumbar puncture.  The
patient had an elevated lactate, and also there was no clear
source of infection.  She was started on antibiotics.  She
was admitted to the intensive care unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Legally blind.

Osteoporosis.

Right occipital stroke in [**3125**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Femoral hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin.
2. Fosamax.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Liver cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with her daughter.  No
tobacco or alcohol use.  The patient walks with a cane at
baseline.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the ICU, temperature
98.6 degrees, pulse 100, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure
97/51, saturation 100 percent.  General, intubated, elderly
thin female, sedated.  HEENT, pupils 3 mm and sluggishly
reactive.  Neck, no JVD, no carotid bruits.  Pulmonary, clear
to auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular, tachycardia,
regular rhythm, and no murmurs.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities, no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; warm, 2 plus dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.  Skin, no stigmata of endocarditis
noticed.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant labs at the time of ICU
admission, white count 7.5, 0 bands, bicarbonate 17, anion
gap 10, negative UA, troponin 0.07, CPK 84, albumin 2.9, ABG
7.21/39/442, lactate 5.2.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG, normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats
per minute with normal axis and intervals; [**Street Address 1217**]
depressions in V5, V6, and I, new biphasic T-wave in V4
through V6 and I.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed
positive intrahepatic ductal dilatation with mild gallbladder
wall thickening.  Chest x-ray showed no cardiopulmonary
process with some apical scarring.  CT of her head without
contrast showed no hemorrhage, but an old right posterior
infarct with chronic small-vessel ischemic changes and a
possible 1.8 cm aneurysm in her ICA.  A CTA showed no
pulmonary emboli with small pleural effusions bilaterally,
right greater than left, questionable ascites with some fluid
around the pancreas.  An x-ray of her right hand showed no
fracture.  Hip x-ray showed no fracture.  Echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction greater than 55 percent with
dilated right ventricle and some hypokinesis without any
evidence of pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An 85-year-old female who is status post
syncope times 2, admitted with hypotension and hypoxia,
requiring intubation, pressors, and antibiotics that
completely resolved within 2 days.

Infectious disease.  Although the patient appeared septic
upon presentation with an elevated lactate and hypotension,
there was no clear evidence of infection.  Blood pressure
improved and the patient was weaned off pressors after 1
night.  There have been no source or other evidence of
infection.  Therefore, antibiotics were discontinued.  The
patient did have multiple episodes of diarrhea but she was C.
difficile negative.

Hypoxia.  Again, there was no clear etiology of the patient's
hypoxia.  She was extubated without difficulty and remained
on room air for the rest of her hospitalization.

Syncope.  The patient was kept on telemetry.  However, there
was no evidence of arrhythmia.  A CT of her head showed no
change and lumbar puncture was negative.  She had normal
carotid ultrasounds.  An echocardiogram showed small right
ventricular hypokinesis and dilation with tricuspid
regurgitation.  The patient was recommended to have an
outpatient MRA/MRI to evaluate questionable aneurysm seen on
CT scan.

Abnormal right upper quadrant ultrasound.  The patient had
mild transaminase with ductal dilatation and gallbladder wall
thickening on right upper quadrant ultrasound.  The patient's
LFTs trended downwards.  The patient was recommended to have
an outpatient MRCP to evaluate for stones in her common bile
duct.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with
services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Alert and oriented, full affect,
presently walking with a cane and assistance, blood pressure
and oxygen saturation are normal.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Syncope of unknown etiology.

Hypotension.

Respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Transaminitis.

History of cerebrovascular accident.

Osteoporosis.

Blindness.

FOLLOW-UP:  Recommended to follow up with her PCP within the
next 1 to 2 weeks.

PLAN:  We recommend outpatient MRI to evaluate questionable
injuries as seen on the CT scan as well as an outpatient MRCP
for elevated transaminitis and dilatation and thickening of
the gallbladder.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
2. Multivitamin 1 capsule p.o. q.d.
3. Fosamax 35 mg 1 tablet p.o. q.d.

     cc of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was administered secondary to language
     barrier.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.
     
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Within the right middle lobe, there is a
     well defined 3 mm nodule present.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are noted.
     Small bulla is also noted within the left lower lobe.  No pleural effusions
     are identified.  The liver appears unremarkable without evidence of
     intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation or focal hepatic masses.  The gallbladder
     is markedly distended with the wall appearing ill-defined and edematous. The
     enhancement of the gallbladder wall mucosa is interrupted at several points,
     highly suggestive of gangrenous cholecystitis.  A small amount of
     pericholecystic fluid is present. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary
     duct dilatation identified. No calcified gallstones are seen. Pancreas,
     spleen, adrenal glands, right kidney, ureters, stomach, and loops of large and
     small bowel are all within normal limits. Within the left kidney, there are
     small parapelvic cysts seen. Both kidneys otherwise enhance symmetrically and
     excrete normal. There is no free air or free fluid. No significant mesenteric
     or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present. There is no bowel obstruction
     present.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, rectum, and
     sigmoid colon are within normal limits.  There is no evidence of bowel

      86 year old woman with chronic cough.                                           
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for pna

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Chronic cough.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3128-7-9**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:   The heart is normal in size.  Tortuosity
     of the aorta is again noted.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
     The lungs are clear.  There are no effusions, focal consolidations, or
     pneumothorax demonstrated.  There is diffuse osteopenia of the osseous
     structures.  Numerous compression fractures are again seen within the thoracic
     spine, not significantly changed since the prior examination.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
                                                                           DFDdp

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      86 year old woman with bruise on right thumb/tenderness s/p fall                
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for fracture

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Bruise on the right thumb and tenderness after fall.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     RIGHT HAND, THREE VIEWS:  The bones are markedly osteopenic, limiting
     sensitivity for detection of fractures.  There is an irregularity of the
     distal radius without a definite fracture line noted; this may represent an
     impacted fracture, chronicity unknown. Degenerative changes are noted within
     the fifth DIP joint with narrowing of the joint space, subchondral sclerotic
     change, and osteophytic spurring.  No soft tissue calcifications are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     1.  Marked osteopenia limiting sensitivity for detection of fractures.
     2.  Irregularity of the distal radius, which may represent an impacted
     fracture, of unknown age. Clinical correlation with the patient's pain is
     recommended.
     3.  Osteoarthritic changes.
     
     RIGHT RADIUS AND ULNA, TWO VIEWS:  The bones are severely osteopenic.  No
     dislocations are identified.  Again noted is irregularity of the distal right
     radius, without a definite fracture line identified, which may represent an
     impacted fracture of unknown age.  No soft tissue calcifications are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Irregularity of the distal radius, suggestive of an impacted fracture,
     chronicity unknown.
     
                                                                           DFDdp
