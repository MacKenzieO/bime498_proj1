Admission Date:  [**2933-10-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2933-11-7**]

Date of Birth:   [**2853-4-10**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
gentleman admitted for sinus bradycardia.

The patient went to see his primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7183**]) on the day of admission with a complaint of ankle
swelling for the past one to two months.  There, he was noted
to have sinus bradycardia on an electrocardiogram with a rate
in the 30s to 40s.  He was urgently sent for cardiac
evaluation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

He was seen in Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 7184**] office with an interpreter.
Apparently, he is able to walk five to ten blocks.  He
complains of pain and cramping in the left calf which wakes
him from [**Doctor Last Name 314**] times the past several months.  It does not
involve his toes.  It occurs less in the right leg.  Not
clearly provoked by exertion.  Clearly worse at night.

Therefore, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had the patient admitted directly to
the floor for management.  He requested the patient have a
cardiac catheterization for consideration of a pacemaker
placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  History of radiation to the larynx in the Soviet [**Hospital1 **] in
the 1970s for presumed laryngeal cancer.  No further details
available.
5.  History of aspiration pneumonia.
6.  History of gastrojejunostomy tube; status post aspiration
pneumonia (now removed).
7.  History of syncopal episode last Fall and Holter monitor
in [**2932-12-12**] showing sinus bradycardia, but not
severe.
8.  History of abnormal stress test in [**2932-2-12**].  The
patient had chest pain and a positive stress test showing a
moderate sized inferior wall reversible defect and was
referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 70**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who advised cardiac
catheterization at that time.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications prior to admission
included)
1.  Avandia 4 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Cozaar 50 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Glyburide 3 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol.
He is Russian-speaking only and lives in [**Location **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical
examination upon admission revealed the patient was a
well-developed and well-developed Russian-speaking white
gentleman.  The patient was alert and in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck examination revealed no
lymphadenopathy.  Normal thyroid.  Bilateral carotid bruits
were auscultated.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds auscultated.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Lower extremity
examination revealed 1+ edema bilaterally.  Groin examination
revealed no bruits.  Skin examination revealed no rashes.
Neurologic examination was grossly intact.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was admitted to the
telemetry floor.  He was monitored overnight without any
evidence of symptomatic bradycardia.

He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2933-10-30**]
with stent placement in the right coronary artery and left
anterior descending artery.  The catheterization also showed
diffuse left circumflex disease.

Status post catheterization, the patient had a vagal episode
resulting in his heart rate decreasing to 39 and a systolic
blood pressure in the 60s.  He responded to 1 mg of atropine.
There were no electrocardiogram changes noted at this time.
He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Losartan.
No beta blocker was given in light of the patient's sinus
bradycardia.

Status post cardiac catheterization, the patient was also
noted to have an elevation in his creatine kinase levels to
values of 1034; however, the MB fraction was low.  It was
felt that this was secondary to difficult hemostasis status
post sheath removal after his cardiac catheterization.  It
was not felt to be related to continued coronary ischemia.

In light of this elevation of creatine kinase levels, the
patient underwent an ultrasound of his right groin in order
to rule out pseudoaneurysm formation.  This was negative.

2.  CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient underwent
bilateral carotid Doppler ultrasound on [**2933-10-30**].
This showed right internal carotid stenosis of 80% to 99%,
left internal carotid artery stenosis of 80% to 99%, and left
internal carotid artery stenosis of 70% to 79%.

It was felt that the patient's carotid stenosis could be
contributing to his bradycardia.  A magnetic resonance
imaging/magnetic resonance angiography of the patient's head
and neck was planned to further evaluate his carotid disease,
but this was unable to be obtained secondary to the patient's
recent coronary artery stent placement.

The patient was seen by the Vascular Surgery Service
regarding his asymptomatic carotid stenosis and was felt not
to be a surgical candidate in light of his need to continue
Plavix for three months status post carotid artery stent
placement.  Therefore, the patient underwent carotid stent
placement via a subclavian angiography on [**2933-11-4**].
He underwent a baseline computed tomography scan of the head
which was negative prior to this intervention.

He was also seen in consultation by the Neurology Stroke
Service.  They performed serial examinations before and after
his carotid artery stent placement.

Status post carotid artery stent placement, the patient was
monitored in the Coronary Care Unit overnight; specifically,
to maintain blood pressure values in the 120 to 150 range in
case he needed pressor support.

Overall, the patient tolerated the right internal carotid
artery stent placement well with no neurologic events.  He
was transferred to the floor on [**2933-11-5**].  On the
floor, he underwent neurologic check every four hours.  His
Losartan dose was decreased to 25 mg by mouth once per day in
order to maintain a systolic blood pressure in the 120 to 150
range.  He was continued on aspirin and was to continue
Plavix therapy for life.

3.  SINUS BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  Initially, the patient was
admitted for evaluation and likely pacemaker placement.
However, the pacemaker evaluation was postponed pending
evaluation of the patient's coronary arteries and carotid
arteries.

As reported above, the patient underwent stenting to the mid
left anterior descending artery and distal right coronary
artery.  The patient also underwent stenting to the right
internal coronary artery.  This resulted in a subsequent
increase in his heart rate.  At that point, it was felt that
the patient no longer warranted emergent pacemaker placement.
He was discharged to home on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1282**] of Hearts monitor in
order to further evaluate his heart rate for any evidence of
symptomatic bradycardia.  He was to follow up in three weeks
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further evaluation.

4.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  Throughout his hospital
stay, the patient was maintained on a regular insulin
sliding-scale.  His outpatient oral hypoglycemic regimen was
initiated prior to discharge, and he tolerated this well.

5.  RIGHT LUNG NODULE ISSUES:  The patient had evidence of a
right upper lung nodule of 9 mm in diameter.  This was seen
on a baseline computed tomography of the chest that was
evaluated during this admission.  Per Radiology, it was
recommended that the patient undergo a follow-up computed
tomography scan in three months in order to assess for
interval change.  If an interval change does occur, the
patient should undergo an outpatient evaluation of the mass
including a possible oncologic workup.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bradycardia.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Carotid artery stenosis.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
6.  Lung nodule.
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
8.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Avandia 4 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Losartan 20 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Glyburide 3 mg by mouth twice per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to make an appointment with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2891**]) for three
weeks after discharge.
2.  The patient was also instructed to make an appointment
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for three months after discharge.
3.  The patient already had a follow-up appointment scheduled
with his primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7183**]) in the
[**Doctor Last Name **] Building on [**2933-12-8**] at 10:20 a.m.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      80 year old man with h/o bilateral carotid disease now being considered for 
      surgery or stenting.  
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval status of bilateral carotid artery disease                                 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Follow-up of known bilateral carotid artery disease in an 80-year-
     old man, who is now being considered for surgery or stent placement.
     
     COMPARISON: Prior similar examination from [**2931-4-25**] had shown (1) an 80
     to 99% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA), (2) a 70-79%
     stenosis of the left ICA, and (3) the absence of visualization of the left
     vertebral artery.
     
     TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color Doppler and spectral Doppler
     examinations were performed at the level of the cervical portions of the
     bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries.
     
     On the right, plaque is present in the mid/upper portions of the common
     carotid artery (CCA) and in the lower and midportions of the ICA. The
     velocities in the ICA, CCA and ECA (external carotid artery) are 526/182,
     73/12, and 126 cm/second, respectively. The peak systolic velocity ratio
     between the ICA and CCA is 7.2. Again, the right vertebral artery is not
     visualized.
     
     On the left, plaque is detected in mid/upper portion of the CCA and at the
     origins of the ICA and ECA. The velocities are 257/54 cm/sec in the ICA, 70/16
     cm/sec in the CCA (196/48 cm/sec in the distal portion of this CCA), and 154
     cm/sec in the ECA. The left ICA-to-CCA peak velocity ratio is 3.67. There is
     antegrade flow in the left vertebral artery, with a peak systolic velocity of
     80 cm/second.
     
     CONCLUSION: No major change as compared to the report of [**2931-4-12**]:
     1. 80 to 99% stenosis in the right ICA,
     2. 70 to 79% stenosis in the left ICA, and
     3. absence of visualization of the right vertebral artery.

     INDICATION:  Bradycardia, pleural-based mass, peripheral edema; evaluate for
     congestive heart failure.
     
     VIEWS: PA & lateral views, comparison dated [**2932-12-19**].
     
     FINDINGS:  Again seen is stable cardiomegaly with marked left ventricular
     enlargement and minimal upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution.  No
     pleural effusions or areas of focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax.  A
     rounded opacity is again seen overlying the right lateral chest wall.  This is
     associated with an apparent discontinuity in the cortex of the right 8th rib.
     This area of abnormal density appears more prominent than on the previous
     examination of approximately one year earlier.  No other areas of abnormality
     within the osseous structures to suggest metastatic disease.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Stable cardiomegaly with minimal left heart failure.
     2. Interval increased prominence of right lateral chest wall mass associated
     with fracture of the right 8th rib.  These findings may be consistent with old
     healing fracture of the right 8th rib with prolific callus formation. However,
     chest wall mass and pathologic fracture are also possible.  If clinically
     indicated, a CT evaluation of the chest is recommended to further evaluate
     this finding.  Bone scan or PET CT may also be of benefit.

     CHEST:  There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph adenopathy.  Dense
     calcifications are noted within the coronary arteries.  There is a small
     pericardial effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis in the right upper lobe
     anteriorly.  Also within the right upper lobe, there is a 7 mm x 10 mm non-
     calcified nodular density.  Healed right 8th posterolateral rib fracture is
     again noted.  There is no apparent soft tissue mass component to this lesion.
     
     ABDOMEN:  Tiny calcifications are noted within the stomach and liver, likely
     residua of previous granulomatous disease.  No other focal liver lesions are
     seen.  The spleen, atrophic pancreas, gallbladder, left adrenal gland, and
     right kidney are grossly unremarkable.  There is a 2.4 cm fat-containing
     lesion within the medial limb of the right adrenal gland, consistent with an
     adenoma.  Two simple cysts are noted at the mid-pole of the left kidney. There
     is no retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy.  There is no free abdominal fluid or
     free air.  The bowel is not well assessed without oral contrast material, but
     loops are non-dilated and grossly unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS:  There is a moderate amountof stranding within the soft tissues of the
     right groin, but there is no evidence of hematoma or fluid collection.  There
     is no retroperitoneal hematoma.  The bladder and prostate gland are grossly
     unremarkable.  Sigmoid diverticuli are noted without evidence of acute
     diverticulitis.  There is vicarious excretion of contrast within the colon,
     likely residua of recent cardiac catheterization.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the spine.  There is
     a healing fracture of the right 8th posterolateral rib as previously
     described.  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Hematrocrit drop with right thigh and groin ecchymoses.  Question
     retroperitoneal hematoma.  Abnormality noted on chest CT.  Assess for chest
     wall mass.
     
     COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray [**2933-10-30**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis were
     obtained without oral or intravenous contrast.
     
     CHEST:  There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph adenopathy.  Dense
     calcifications are noted within the coronary arteries.  There is a small
     pericardial effusion.  There is minimal atelectasis in the right upper lobe
     anteriorly.  Also within the right upper lobe, there is a 7 mm x 10 mm non-
     calcified nodular density.  Healed right 8th posterolateral rib fracture is
     again noted.  There is no apparent soft tissue mass component to this lesion.
     
     ABDOMEN:  Tiny calcifications are noted within the stomach and liver, likely
     residua of previous granulomatous disease.  No other focal liver lesions are
     seen.  The spleen, atrophic pancreas, gallbladder, left adrenal gland, and
     right kidney are grossly unremarkable.  There is a 2.4 cm fat-containing
     lesion within the medial limb of the right adrenal gland, consistent with an
     adenoma.  Two simple cysts are noted at the mid-pole of the left kidney. There
     is no retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy.  There is no free abdominal fluid or
     free air.  The bowel is not well assessed without oral contrast material, but
     loops are non-dilated and grossly unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS:  There is a moderate amountof stranding within the soft tissues of the
     right groin, but there is no evidence of hematoma or fluid collection.  There
     is no retroperitoneal hematoma.  The bladder and prostate gland are grossly
     unremarkable.  Sigmoid diverticuli are noted without evidence of acute
     diverticulitis.  There is vicarious excretion of contrast within the colon,
     likely residua of recent cardiac catheterization.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the spine.  There is
     a healing fracture of the right 8th posterolateral rib as previously
     described.  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
                                                                 (Over)

     SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB: 
      
     Exercise protocol:  Modified [**Doctor Last Name 61**]. 
     Exercise duration:  7.5 minutes.    
     Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained:  73%. 
     Symptoms during exercise:  no anginal symptoms. 
     Reason exercise terminated:  fatigue. 
     ECG findings:  uninterpretable secondary to baseline abnormalities. 
      
     INTERPRETATION:  
      
     Imaging Protocol:  SPECT.  Gating could not be performed secondary to 
     arrhythmia. 
      
     Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201. 
     Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. 
     Exercise images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
      
     Both stress and resting perfusion images show no myocardial perfusion defects.  
      
     IMPRESSION:  No perfusion defects visualized.  Gating could not be performed s
     secondary to arrhythmia, and as a result, wall motion and ejection fraction
     could not be evaluated.

     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST
     
     INDICATION:  81 year-old male with previously noted right upper lobe lung
     nodule.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior CT torso examination of [**2933-11-1**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast helical CT images of the chest were performed.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The previously described 9 mm nodule seen
     in the right upper lobe is unchanged in size or appearance.  No new nodules or
     lung masses are seen.  There are no areas of consolidation.  No pleural
     effusions.  There is no mediastinal, axillary, or hilar lymph node
     enlargement.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are stable in
     appearance.  Severe coronary artery calcifications are again noted.  There is
     no change to a very small pericardial effusion.  The airways are patent to the
     level of the subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
     
     Within the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, note is again made of a
     1.8 x 2.7 cm fat containing lesion of the right adrenal gland, consistent by
     CT characteristics, with a adrenal benign adenoma.  A left sided simple renal
     cysts is again noted.  A few tiny calcified granulomas within the liver are
     again noted as well.  There is no change to previously noted healed fracture
     of the right posterolateral rib fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Stable appearance to right upper lobe 9 mm lung nodule.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON: Known stenosis perform followup.
     
     Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries. Significant plaque
     was identified on the left. On the right internal carotid artery stent is
     identified and is patent.
     
     On the right peak systolic velocities are 84, 110, 251 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively. The ICA:CCA ratio is 0.8. This is consistent with no stenosis.
     
     On the left peak systolic velocities are 208, 83, 164 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
     respectively. The ICA:CCA ratio is 2.5. This is consistent with a 60 to 69%
     stenosis.
     
     There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
     
     IMPRESSION: Significant left-sided plaque with a 60 to 69% carotid stenosis.
     This appears stable from prior study. On the right there is no evidence of
     stenosis status post carotid stent. Of note the plaque on the left carotid
     artery extends fairly proximally to the mid common carotid artery.
