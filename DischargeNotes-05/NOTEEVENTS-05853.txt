Admission Date:  [**2501-7-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2501-8-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2436-9-17**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Hemoptysis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64 year-old male
with the past medical history of diverticulitis, pipe smoking
who noticed mild hemoptysis in early [**Female First Name (un) 493**]. The patient
initially thought nothing of the hemoptysis and continued
with his daily activities. The next day the patient noticed a
larger amount of hemoptysis which worried him. The patient
went to his primary care physician who performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest
x-ray and a chest CT scan which revealed a right upper lobe
mass and enlarged subcarinal lymph[**MD Number 65**]. The patient was
subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 75**]
for elective bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsy. The
procedure was performed on [**2501-7-26**] and it revealed a tumor
obstructing the anterior segment of the right upper lobe.
During this procedure the patient developed worsening
hemoptysis with frank aspiration. He had Vfib arrest during
the procedure and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He
was intubated and admitted to the [**Hospital1 797**] ICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diverticulitis.
2.  Low HDL.
3.  Rosacea.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Gemfibrozil.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in [**Location 7275**]. He is a retired
Army officer. Pipe smoker times 20 years with inhalation.
Cigarette smoking for 20 years prior to the pipe smoking.
Occasional alcohol use. No IV drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission vitals 98.4 F, heart
rate 95, blood pressure 142/93. Ventilator settings PEEP of
5, AC 600 times 16.

General - intubated, sedated.  Cardiovascular exam - regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2. Lungs - rhonchi, coarse
breath sounds. Abdomen - positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended, no rebound or guarding. Extremities
- no edema.

LABORATORY DATA: Upon admission white blood cell count 11.1,
hematocrit 31.9, platelet count 25.4, calcium 7.6, phosphorus
5.2, magnesium 1.9, sodium 142, potassium 4.0 chloride 107,
bicarb 25, BUN 25, creatinine 1.1, glucose 215, ALT 10, AST
13, alkaline phosphatase 112, T bilirubin 0.2. ABG revealed a
pH 7.14.

Chest x-ray revealed a right upper lobe mass. Chest CT scan
confirmed right upper lobe mass with subcarinal lymph[**MD Number 65**].

HOSPITAL COURSE: In the MICU the patient developed an
aspiration pneumonia and was treated appropriately with a
course of Levofloxacin, Clindamycin and Vancomycin. He
received aggressive pulmonary toilet. The patient's code
status was changed from full code to DNR / DNI. The patient
was extubated successfully but secretions remained tenacious.
The patient received five cycles of radiation treatment and
tolerated them well.

The patient had intermittent episodes of agitation per MICU
house staff team. The patient did not respond to Haldol but
was somewhat responsive to benzodiazepine. A Geriatric
consult was requested and the patient was placed on Zyprexa
2.5 mg po bid. The patient required intermittent posing and
he was a fall risk.

The patient received nutrition via an NG tube. The patient
was placed on FS Promote with fiber at 70 cc an hour which he
tolerated well. The patient underwent a video swallow at the
bedside which he failed due to aspiration. The patient
underwent a video swallow examination with fluoroscopy which
he also failed due to a great deal of retained pharyngeal
contents and poor cough reflex.

The patient was transferred to 7 .................... and
over three days his mental status improved steadily. The
patient underwent another video swallow examination with
fluoroscopy. The patient did better on this video swallow.
The patient continued to have a good deal of aspiration and
recommendations were made to keep the patient NPO and to
provide primary nutrition through other means. The patient
was evaluated by Interventional Radiology and a J tube was
placed with good placement in the proximal jejunum. The
patient was restarted on his FS Promote and reached goal rate
without any abdominal discomfort.  The patient was restarted
on his Zyprexa via the GJ tube.

The patient's pulmonary function continued to improve while
on the Medicine floor. He ambulated quite well around the
nurse's station times two every day with Physical Therapy.
His O2 requirement stayed steady around two liters by nasal
cannula with saturation around 93 to 94%.  The patient was
continued on aggressive pulmonary toilet. The patient used
incentive spirometry at the bedside with good affect. The
patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for
further work up of his Non-small cell lung carcinoma and was
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 976**]
[**Hospital3 **] for further care of his cancer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg po / NG q day.
2.  Dulcolax one per rectum q day prn.
3.  Zyprexa 2.5 mg per GJ tube bid.
4.  Tylenol 650 mg per GJ tube q six hours prn.

     PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison made to film of one day earlier.
     
     ET tube and NG tube remain in satisfactory position.  The tip of a new right
     IJ catheter is in the SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax on this
     supine film.  An area of consolidation in the right mid-chest is again noted.
     There is also a small focus of patchy increased density in the left apex,
     better seen today, which could represent a second site of focal infiltrate.
     There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings, which was noted yesterday
     on the right, but is more conspicuous today in the left hemithorax; mild
     diffuse interstitial edema cannot be excluded.  Diffuse haziness throughout
     much of the right hemithorax may reflect a posteriorly layering pleural
     effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:1)  New right IJ catheter tip in SVC; no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     2)  Patchy increased density in left apex may represent a second site of focal
     infiltrate.
     
     3)  Diffuse increase in interstitial markings, more pronounced in the left
     hemithorax today, could reflect mild diffuse interstitial edema.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Patient coded in the Bronchoscopy Suite.
     
     Axial CT scans of the brain were obtained before and after the administration
     of intravenous contrast.
     
     There are no previous studies for comparison.
     
     FINDINGS:
     No focal attenuation abnormalities of the brain parenchyma are identified.
     [**Doctor Last Name **]/white matter differentiation is preserved. There is no evidence of acute
     intracranial hemorrage. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.
     There is no shift of intracranial structures.
     
     Postcontrast images demonstrate a collection of thin, but prominent,
     serpentine blood vessels in the right parietal lobe. It is unclear if this
     represents a vascular anomaly or abnormal enhancement due to local effects,
     such as luxury perfusion.
     
     No lytic or destructive lesions of the skull are identified.
     
     There is rounded mucosal density in the maxillary sinuses and a small amount
     of fluid and mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. There is also fluid
     in the sphenoid sinus. The mastoids and middle ears are normally aerated.
     
     IMPRESSION: There is no clear evidence of cortical infarction or intracranial
     mass effect at this time. There is a right parietal lobe area of prominent
     vascular enhancement. Further evaluation with MRI may be diagnostically useful
     to determine if this represents a vascular malformation.

     Comparison is made to film from one day earlier.
     
     The ET tube, NG tube, and central venous catheter remain in satisfactory
     position.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.
     
     The known focal opacity in the right suprahilar region is again noted and may

Nsg Progress Note 7p-7a
Neuro: Sedated on 100mcg/kg/min of propofol. Was able to tolerate only 60mcg but during the night he coughed up what appeared to be an old bloody mucous plug. At this time his Bp went up to SBP 160's and his resp rate increased. Pt appeared very uncomfortable and restless, therefore the gtt was increased with good effect. Pupils 2-3mm equal and reactive. Occassionally moves lower extremeties but no real purposeful movement.

CV: Normal sinus rhythm 80-90's with some PAC's and PVC's this early am. K+ and Mg+ pending. Bp stable t/o the noc currently 124/57. Right IJ placed last evening and placement confirmed by CXR. Left femoral line d/c'd and sent for CX. Continues with a left radial A-line correlates well to NBP. Good pedal pulses, trace edema in extremeties and some periorbital edema noted. Hct/Hgb this am 24.5/8.9. MD aware, no orders given.

RESP: Intubated on AC. Tolerated a slow wean [** 493**]. Current settings AC rate 12, TV 700, PEEP 5, Fio2 40%. ABG on this setting 7.39/39/103. Lungs coarse and dim @ bases. As mentioned, pt coughed up some old bloody mucous into ETT tube and required some suctioning to relieve congestion. Sat 90% at that time. Suctioned only in ETT tube, did not go down deep [**Name8 (MD) 34**] MD request. No lavage.

GI: NG clamped in left nare d/t no output. Placement confirmed. Abd soft with hypo bos. No BM since admission on [**7-26**].

GU: Foley to gravity draining clear yellow urine. Urine for c&S sent last noc.  Pt starting to auto diurese this am with outputs >350 the last two hours.

ID: Tmax this shift 101.8. Currently 98.6. WBC's down today at 10.3. Second set of Blood Cx's sent last evening along with urine and femoral cath. tip.

Social: Wife phoned X2 [**Name2 (NI) 493**]. Has support from son and daughter-in-law.

     PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST IMAGE dated [**2501-8-1**] is compared with the prior
     study from [**2501-7-31**]. There is essentially no interval change in this radiograph.
     Again noted is a 4.6 cm rounded opacity within the right mid zone, presumably
     located in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Again noted is an
     ill-defined loss of translucency within the right base, possibly pneumonic in
     origin. There is patchy atelectasis in the left lower lobe located posterior
     to the heart. The heart size is normal with no evidence of congestive heart
     failure. In addition, some background emphysematous disease may be present.
     
     IMPRESSION: No interval change as compared with the prior study from [**7-31**].

     1.  Nasogastric tube terminates within the proximal stomach.
     
     2.  It is not possible to assess the lung parenchyma due to the post-

     PORTABLE CHEST:
     
     INDICATION: NG tube placement.
     
     An NG tube terminates within the fundus of the stomach. Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs reveal a focal
     rounded opacity in the right suprahilar region which appears slightly
     decreased compared to the previous study. There is some associated right upper
     lobe volume loss. The lungs demonstrate patchy increased opacity in the right
     lung adjacent to the minor fissure, with interval improvement compared to
     earlier studies. Overinflation of the lungs is noted and there is minimal
     linear atelectasis at the left base.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) NG tube terminates in the proximal stomach.
     
     2) Confluent area of somewhat rounded opacity in right suprahilar region
     adjacent to an elevated minor fissure. This shows interval decrease in size
     compared to earlier studies dating back to [**2501-7-26**]. Without a lateral view, it
     is difficult to tell with certainty whether this is a focal parenchyma mass or
     area of pleural abnormality such as loculated fluid within the minor fissure.
     Dedicated PA & lateral view would be helpful in this regard, when the
     patient's condition permits. By report, there is history of lung cancer.
     
     3) Improving pneumonia in the right lung which has nearly resolved.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer, s/p hemorrhage at bronchoscopy,
     failing video swallow study following extubation.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS:  Procedure performed by Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1562**] and [**Doctor Last Name 179**].  The staff
     radiologist present for procedure.
     
     TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE:  The patient was informed of the details and associated
     risks of the procedure and written consent was obtained.  The patient was
     placed supine on the angiographic table and the abdomen was sterile prepped
     and draped in the usual fashion.  The stomach was insufflated via patient's
     NGT.  1% Lidocaine was administered intravenously to provide local anesthesia.
     Under fluoroscopic guidance two T-fasteners were inserted within the stomach
     to tack the stomach to the abdominal wall.  Between the two T-fasteners a
     0.035 [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced through an introducer needle under
     fluoroscopic guidance.  Introducer needle was exchanged for a Kumpe catheter.
     The catheter and [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire was advanced to the distal duodenum. The Kumpe
     catheter was then exchanged over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] wire for serial 7, 10 and 12
     French dilators and a 14.5 French Schetty catheter is advanced through a 14
     Frenc peel-away sheath over the [**Last Name (un) 129**] guide wire such that the tip is at the
     distal duodenum.  Contrast injection through the J-tube with abdominal
     radiograph confirms tip to be within the distal duodenum.  The pigtail loop is
     formed and the G-J tube secured in position with flexi-track.  There were no
     immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 14.5 French Schetty G-J with tip at the
     proximal jejunum.
