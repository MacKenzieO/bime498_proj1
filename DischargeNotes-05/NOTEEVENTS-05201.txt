Admission Date:  [**2991-1-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2991-1-31**]

Date of Birth:   [**2921-12-20**]       Sex:  F

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
MI in [**2987**] with stent to LAD and RCA at the same time.  The
patient reports no angina until [**9-30**].  She has been
medically managed.  She presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-19**]
with complaints of progressive paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
primarily one week prior to admission.  By [**1-19**] had severe
shortness of breath, wheezing and cough.  EKG was positive
for anterior and lateral ST depression, troponin 1.7.  The
patient was treated with Lasix, Nitroglycerin, Lovenox and
Aspirin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes coronary artery disease,
status post MI in [**2987**] and status post stent to the LAD and
RCA.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, DJD, hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Artificial sweeteners.

MEDICATIONS:  Diovan 160 mg po q d, Atenolol 25 mg po q d,
Aspirin 81 mg po q d, NPH 30 units subcu bid, Trilisate 500
mg po bid, Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable,
states pain since admission.  Vital signs, 158/80 blood
pressure, heart rate in the 60's, breathing 16.  Lungs
decreased at the bases with fine crackles [**12-2**] of the way up.
Room air sat 98%, distant heart sounds, regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen is soft, nontender
with bowel sounds present.  DP and PT pulses are palpable
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.8, hematocrit 43, platelet
count 262,000, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9.  Cardiac
catheterization showed a three vessel disease with an EF of
20%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stabilized on the C-Med
service and was taken to the operating room on [**2991-1-25**] for
three vessel CABG with LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft
to RCA and to OM1.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediately
post-operatively.  On postoperative day #1 the patient's Swan
Ganz catheter was removed and the patient was weaned off the
Neo-Synephrine.  On postoperative day #2 the patient noted
some visual disturbances.  Carotid ultrasound studies showed
mild plaque in the left ICA of no hemodynamic significance
and normal antegrade flow in the vertebral artery.  The right
carotid was unable to be seen due to line placement.
Neurology saw the patient and diagnosed her with balance
syndrome.  Physical therapy saw the patient on [**2991-1-28**] and
noted that the patient could probably benefit from short term
rehab stay.  On [**2991-1-29**], postoperative day #4, the patient's
Foley was removed and the patient was out of bed ambulating.
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
#4, [**2991-1-29**].  On postoperative day #5 the patient's wires were
removed.  The patient continued to do well.  Physical therapy
saw the patient again on [**2991-1-30**] and thought that she was
still very deconditioned and limited with activity and so
would benefit from short term rehab stay.  The patient was
discharged to rehab on [**2991-1-31**] on the following medications:
Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po bid times 7 days,
KCL 40 mEq po q d times 7 days, Colace 100 mg po bid, Zantac
150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, NPH insulin 30 units
subcu bid, sliding scale regular insulin and Percocet 5/325
1-2 tabs po  4-6 hours prn.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post CABG times three vessels.

     COMPARISON:  [**2991-1-23**] preop film.
     
     FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Suboptimal technique as right costophrenic angle in
     not included in the study.  There is moderate cardiomegaly and prominence of
     the pulmonary vasculature with slight upper zone redistribution suggesting
     some degree of heart failure without pulmonary edema or effusions.  There is a
     new opacification in a retrocardiac location in the left lower lobe consistent
     with collapse and consolidation.  In addition, there is minor linear
     atelectasis in the left midlung.  There are no pleural effusions, although the
     study is limited as the right costophrenic angle is clipped.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     In the interval since the prior study median sternotomy wires and surgical
     clips overlying the heart are consistent with known CABG.  In addition, there
     is a central line sheath entering via right internal jugular access.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
     2.  Enlarged heart with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of
     mild heart failure.
     3.  Collapse and consolidation of the left lower lobe.
     4.  Interval placement of right IJ central line sheath and clips and wires
     associated with CABG.

     CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
     
     HISTORY:  CVA suspected.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT scan was obtained.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a moderately large, probably subacute infarct within the
     right temporal lobe.  There is no associated hemorrhage.  The acuity of this
     lesion could be confirmed with more specific clinical history regarding the
     observed neurologic deficit.  The scan is also notable for smaller, more
     disseminated areas of low density within the white matter of both cerebral
     hemispheres, likely representing chronic microvascular infarction.  A probable
     chronic lacunar infarct is seen, one each within the genu of the right
     internal capsule as well as the left lentiform nucleus.  There is no
     hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  The surrounding
     osseous and soft tissue structures appear within normal limits.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Probable subacute, moderate-sized right temporal lobe infarct.
