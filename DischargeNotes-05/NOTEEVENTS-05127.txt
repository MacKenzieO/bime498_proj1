Date of Birth:  [**2438-11-7**]             Sex:   M
 
Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3996**] 
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5868**] is a 74M w/DM on glyburide, renal xplant in [**2499**] [**3-3**] 
hereditary nephritis, lymphoma 9ya s/p RCHOP, SCC scalp excised 
in [**2513-7-30**], afib on flecainide, MS, circumcision last week who 
presented to the ED w/2 days of hypoglycemia, also found to have 
low BP.
.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5868**] is not aware of why he is in the hospital.  He is able 
to describe frequent falls [**3-3**] MS which increased over [**Holiday 1726**] 
and New Years.  He denies vertigo with the falls, but does 
report decreased streadiness when his blood sugars are low.  He 
takes his own medications and his list is extensive as below.
. 
He presented to [**Hospital 1922**] hospital yesterday with mental status 
changes, BG18 and hyopthermia.  His urinalysis was negative at 
that time and he was sent home.  He returned w/hypoglycemia and 
was thus transferred to BDIMC.  In our ED, his VS were 100.6  
104/58  80  98RA w/next BP 86/50.  He was given 1L NS, 1/2A D50, 
D10 drip and levofloxacin.  At the time of transfer to the CCU 
under MICU service, his BP was 89/63 and FS142.
.
His ROS is notable for the falls, dysphagia to solid foods for 
years, mild dysphagia, and recent GI ilness (upper and lower) of 
his wife for a few weeks; he had similar symptoms for several 
days two weeks ago.  While he gives some detailed history, his 
answers to many questions are tangential and circumstantial, and 
in response to being asked why he is here, he describes a 
vacation that he took with his wife to [**Name2 (NI) **] five years ago, 
and her diarrheal ilness.  His PCP reports that this is baseline 
for him.  His wife reports that he takes all of his own 
medications, and does not typically make mistakes.

 
Social History:
Lives w/his wife; performs own ADLs, never smoked.  Never IVDA.  
<2 glasses wine per day.
 
Family History:
Mother, sister, and father died of CVAs in 60s, 60s, 78 years 
old, respectively.  Two children w/ESRD [**3-3**] hereditary 
nephritis.

sensation intact and symetric to soft touch, reflexes 1+ 
throughout, toes upgoing bil, responds to year as 2007, date as 
[**2-16**], time of day as morning.  Responds to reason for being in 
hospital explaining first his wife's diarrhea ilness, then a 
trip to [**Location (un) **] 5 years ago.  Says that five [**Last Name (un) 5869**] and a dime 
make 35c and that if he found a stamped adressed envelope on the 
street, he would mail it.
Lymph: No LAD in ant/post cervical chains, submental,

heart, mediastinum, and hilar regions are otherwise within 
normal limits.  The lungs are clear. 
.
[**2513-2-15**] 05:15AM   DIGOXIN-0.5*
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
.
74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and 
low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.  It is not clear if his 
glyburide was recently increased--this could be a primary 
contributor to his presentation.  He has an evident ballantitis 
which could also be contributing.
.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**3-3**] glyburide in the 
context of recent illness and polypharmacy.  On the evening 
following admission, his blood glucose levels were maintained at 
normal levels with D51/2NS gtt titrated to q1 hour fingersticks. 
 Glyburide's half life is 24 hours, and in keeping with this, 
hypoglycemic effect wore out within 24 hours of admission.  
Subsequently blood glucose levels were >200 and the dextrose 
support was discontinued.  With the resolution of hypoglycemia, 
sliding scale insulin was initiated.  After transfer from the 
MICU, the patient had blood sugars > 250.  He was started on low 
dose glipizide prior to discharge.  Although Glipizide still has 
some interaction with voriconazole, it has less interaction that 
Glyburide.  The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole 
for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was 
not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.  The Glipizide was 
started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in 
the 250 range.  He will be seen by his primary care doctor 
shortly after discharge for further titration of meds. 
.
2) UTI- The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone which would 
cover both his UTI and balantitis.  Culture results were 
negative.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin.
.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent 
circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.  A 
swab gram stain negative.  The wound culture was found to grown 
Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent 
with skin floral.  The patient was continued on a topical 
antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone.  Additionally, a DFA was 
negative for HSV.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin 
and will followup with his [**Hospital1 84**] Urologist. 
.
4) Thrombocytopenia:  Thought to be [**3-3**] drug effect of 
voriconazole vs. ranitidine; however, per PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 84**], he has had 
baseline thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned 
as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks 
vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.  At [**Hospital1 83**], patient's 
ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on 
platelets.  Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to 
112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's 
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was instructed not to take 
Ranitidine anymore.  He will followup at [**Hospital1 84**] for further 
monitoring of his thrombocytopenia.
.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on 
lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary 
aspergillosis.
.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush 
upon admission to the MICU.  He was continued on voriconazole 
and nystatin S&S was added to his regimen.  He had no further 
evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.  
.
7) Afib/SSS- Has PPM but currently native sinus driven.  The 
patient was anticoagulated with warfarin.  Flecainide was 
continued as per his outpatient regimen.  
.
8) S/P renal xplant- Patient was continued on his 
immunosupressives, Tacrolimus.  He was continued on Bactrim for 
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3362**].  He will followup with his renal doctor at [**Hospital3 1909**] upon discharge.
