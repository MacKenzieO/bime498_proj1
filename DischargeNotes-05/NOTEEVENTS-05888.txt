Admission Date:  [**2935-5-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2935-5-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2856-10-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Last Name (un) 1863**] with the
complaint of ""not feeling well"" for the last 24 hours.  She
was taken to the ED via EMS and found to be in third degree
complete heart block with a rate of 37-40, but stable vital
signs.  She was admitted briefly to the ICU with no response
in the ICU to atropine or isoproterenol drip.  Heart rate
remained in the 50s.  At 6:00 am, she had an episode of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia for about 20 beats, which
broke spontaneously.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] ICU via
MedFlight.  She received a sedative en route for prophylactic
transcutaneous pacing.

EXAMINATION:  Temp afebrile, heart rate 47, blood pressure
148/50, respirations 22.  Mucous membranes are dry.
HEENT:  Presence of [**Doctor Last Name 1364**] A waves.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate, rhythm.  A III/VI holosystolic
murmur at the apex.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.

LABORATORY:  Chemistries were 142, 4.6, 109, 24.  BUN 86,
creatinine 2.6, glucose 117, INR 2.5, digoxin level 2.05.
After Digibind administered, digoxin level was 0.32.

EKG:  Showed ventricular escape rhythm at a rate of 48 with
third degree AV block.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed atherosclerotic changes in the aorta.
Clear lungs.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) CARDIOVASCULAR - A) ISCHEMIA:  The
patient with no clear anginal symptoms.  She is now status
post a pacemaker placement on [**5-4**] with normal placement of
leads confirmed by chest x-ray, PA and lateral.  The patient
had a slight bump in her cardiac enzymes from a CK of 194-293
after placement of her pacemaker, which again came down the
next morning.  Her pacemaker appears to be functioning
normally.

B) PUMP:  Her ejection fraction is 30-40% with extensive
anterior apical kinesis, 1+ MR, and 2+ TR.

C) RHYTHM:  Patient initially with complete heart block, now
status post pacemaker functioning normally.

2) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  When the patient initially came,
she was unable to fully communicate.  Her mental status
improved slightly by hospital day #2.  She was able to
communicate and was oriented x 2, but still had some
occasional hallucinations of seeing puppies, or multiple
boxes in the room.  Otherwise, the patient is not agitated.
Her altered mental status may likely be due to a source of
infection, as her white count has increased to 20.

She was also noted to be aspirating at the outside hospital.
Her chest x-ray initially showed some opacities at bilateral
bases, which may be consistent with aspiration.  She was
started on levofloxacin q 48 h, renally adjusted, to be
continued for 7 days for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

3) HYPERTENSION:  The patient noted to be extremely
hypertensive at the outside hospital.  Her blood pressure is
now well-controlled on Lopressor 50 bid, captopril 6.25 tid.
She should have these medications continued to be titrated up
as she tolerates.

4) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient with fractional
secretion of sodium of 0.5 likely secondary to hypotension
and dehydration.  She was cleared by speech and swallow for
nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids.  Although her PO
intake may be decreased due to her altered mental status, we
will continue her on gentle IV fluid hydration.

5) HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient was initially on Coumadin on
admission for atrial fibrillation with an elevated INR.  Her
Coumadin was held, and she was given Vitamin K initially for
pacemaker placement, and her Coumadin was continued to be
followed for 24 hours postpacemaker placement, and will be
restarted today.

6) DIABETES:  She was continued on qid fingersticks and
sliding scale insulin.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be transferred to
[**Hospital3 7362**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po qd.
2. Lipitor 80 mg po qd.
3. Lopressor 50 mg po bid.
4. Captopril 6.25 mg po tid.
5. Pantoprazole 40 mg po qd.
6. Levofloxacin 250 mg po q 48 h x 7 days.
7. Sliding scale insulin, regular.
8. Senna.
9. Colace.
10.Tylenol prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with her
primary care provider [**Name Initial (PRE) 1252**] 1-2 weeks after discharge from
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 579**].

78 year old female admitted from [**Hospital3 1524**] in CHB.  Transfered to [**Hospital1 22**] for pacemaker.

Past Medical History:  IDDM; HTN; Glaucona; DVT's; SVT.

Allergies:  codeine

Pt was feeling poorly for a few days until today she pushed her panic button.  She was transported to [**Hospital1 1525**] where she was found to be in CHB.  Her Dig level was 2.05 so she was given digibind 38mg, repeat dig level was .32 but her heart rhythm remained CHB.  She was given atropine with no response so she was started on isuprel to increase her HR from 30's to 40-50's.  She was transfered to [**Hospital1 22**] for a permant pacemaker.

Review of systems:  Cardiac- pt had been on Isuprel at 2mcg/min but was having long (10-15beats) runs of VT so the ACLS crew dropped the isuprel rate to 1.5 mcg/min.  The amount of PVC decreased but did not affect her HR.  In the MICU her HR was 38-48 CHB with frequent PVC's and runs of VT -up to 4 beats.  B/P 132-141/30's.  She was taken down to the EP lab at 1430 for a pacemaker.

Resp:  RR 16-20 on 4l NC her O2 sats were 98-99.  Breath sounds clear but decreased in the bases.

Neuro:  She is awake but oriented x2.  She was difficult to understand because of slurring of her words but she did appear confused.  Her base line is alert and oriented, living on her own in a retirement facility.  

GI:  Abd soft and non tender, hypoactive bowel sounds.  She remains NPO for the pacer insertion.

GU:  Foley in place draining small amounts of yellow urine.

ID:  temp on admission 100.8 with WBC's 15.3.

Social: She has 3 neices and a sister.  Her Neice [**Name (NI) 1526**] [**Name2 (NI) 67**] was contacted for consent.  [**Doctor First Name 243**] and the patient's sister came in to sign the consent.  [**Doctor First Name 1526**]'s home phone # [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1527**]; work [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1528**].
