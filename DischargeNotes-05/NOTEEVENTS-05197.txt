Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY
.
US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2512-10-7**] 
1. Slightly and coarse liver consistent with patient's known 
history of cirrhosis.
2. No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
3. The gallbladder is not distended but the wall is edematous. 
These are most likely secondary to periportal hypertension. 
Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
5. No evidence of ascites.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2512-10-7**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate right pleural effusion. Right middle and 
lower lobe consolidation may represent pneumonia or compressive 
atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis versus pneumonia.
RENAL U.S.  [**2512-10-10**] 3:09 PM
Reason: MRSA BACTEREMIA ,EVAL FOR ABSCESS
IMPRESSION: Normal-sized kidneys. Splenomegaly. No evidence of 
perirenal abscess.

1. Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. There is a 
small associated right pneumothorax. There has been interval 
decrease in the degree of atelectasis in the right lung. No 
definite empyema is identified.
2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis, including nodular liver, 
and ascites. No enhancing fluid collections within the liver or 
within the abdomen, to suggest the presence of an 
intra-abdominal source of infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with h/o cirrhosis (hep C v. autoimmune) transferred 
from [**Hospital1 250**] with SOB x 3 week and R sided chest pain, pneumonia 
on CXR, elevated lactate and hypoxia. He notes worsening SOB for 
past week with pleuritic chest pain in R side. He also complains 
of fatigue and dysuria. He has some cough but only occasionally 
brings up sputum. He went to [**Hospital3 **] and was given 
ceftriaxone, azithro and solumedrol. He was also found to be in 
acute renal failure with Cr 4.9, K 5.7. Tox screen positive for 
opiates. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] on NRB bc they did not have 
any ICU beds available. He denied fevers, chills, but complained 
of itchy skin.  In the MICU, he was started on Vanc, Levo and 
Ceftriaxone, which was eventually broadened to include flagyl.  
A noncontrast CT showed a RLL consolidation and R pleural 
effusion without evidence of loculation.  Thoracic surgery was 
consulted and they placed a chest tube [**10-8**] with development of 
small basilar PTX --> small R lateral PTX [**10-10**], with drainage 
of ~1.2 L.  Pleural fluid showed 51,500 WBC, 74% PMNs, 2% Bands, 
23% monos, 16,900 RBC, TP 4.4, LDH 5108, Glucose 6, Amylase 21, 
Albumin 2.1 and grew out MRSA.  Blood cultures and Urine 
cultures also grew out MRSA.  Serial cultures have since been 
NGTD from [**10-9**] and [**10-10**].  His Abx regimen was changed to Vanc 
and Levo.  His ARF was thought to be prerenal and he was gently 
hydrated with IVF with a CVP between [**10-12**] to keep CVP > 12.  
Urine eos were negative.  A renal ultrasound was also ordered 
given MRSA in his urine to assess for renal abscess and was 
negative, revealing only trace ascites and an enlarged spleen.  
His BUN/Cr eventually improved from 85/4.2 to 65/1.2  Hepatology 
was called because of his hx of Hep C hepatitis vs. Autoimmune 
hepatitis with AST 79, ALT 71, Alk Phos 151, Bili 7.1 and 
believed that it was more likely an HCV flare with hepatic 
encephalopathy and cholestasis.  They recommended lactulose TID 
to QID, volume resuscitation, holding aldactone until after IVF 
resuscitation and stress dose steroids as well as variceal 
screening once his respiratory status had improved (MELD 31).  
His Liver panel improved to AST 89, ALT 58, Alk Phos 130, Bili 
4.6.  He was started on labetalol and his aldactone was 
restarted.  On [**10-10**], he was d/c'ed to the floor.

55yo man with history of cirrhosis likely secondary to hepatitis 
C
presented with RML/RLL pneumonia, complicated parapneumonic 
effusion, and
high grade MRSA bacteremia. 

# MRSA pneumonia

This was heralded by progressive dyspnea, fever, pleuritic 
symptoms, and hypoxia. He was found to have RML and RLL 
pneumonia. Sputum cultures grew out MRSA. Additionally,
he had a complicated parapneumonic effusion, which required the 
placement of a chest tube for drainage. Pleural fluid grew out 
MRSA as well.  He was initially treated with 
vancomycin/levaquin/flagyl, which was tapered down to 
vanco/levaquin. He made progressive improvement and was weaned 
from NRB to 5L nasal canula.
.
# High grade MRSA bacteremia
Initial blood cultures were significant for 4/4 bottles with 
MRSA. He was continued on vancomycin. TEE did not show any 
vegetations. He also had a renal US to rule out
a perinephric abscess, as he had MRSA in the urine as well which 
is not uncommon with MRSA bacteremia. He was also started on 
Gentamycin and Daptomycin as his bacteremia did not clear with 
Vancomycin. Subsequently his Vanc was D/C'ed as patient 
responded to Daptomycin. Gentamycin was D/C'ed as patient 
developed acute renal failure most likely related to gentamycin 
toxicity. Daptomycin to be continued for 4 weeks after its 
initiation on [**2512-10-19**]. 
.
# Acute renal failure: most likely ATN [**2-3**] Gent toxicity; urine 
sed showed brown muddy casts. FeNa intially did improve with 
hydration and so was thought to be prenal most likely 
Hepato-renal. However given the brown muddy casts and improving 
FeNa, most likely ATN. negative urine eos consistently. 25 g IV 
albumin given [**2512-10-20**]. Peak Creatinine was 6.6 which started 
trending down at the time of discharge. He did not have any 
signs of uremia or severe volume overload and so was not started 
on HD. Will need to check Creatinine every 3-4 days.
.
# Cirrhosis
Medical regimen was optimized with beta blocker for variceal 
bleeding prophylaxis, aldactone for diuresis, and lactulose 
titrated upward for encephalopathy. Liver team was following. 
Bilirubin peaked at 8.9. EGD negative for varices, but showed 
some gastritis - was on PPI.  U/S [**10-10**] showed small amount of 
ascites --> CT [**10-12**] showed large amount of ascites --> 
diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis removed 2 L with SAAG of 
-0.2. Hepatology of opinion that this was not unusual for bad 
cirrhosis.  Vit K 10 mg SC x 3 days finished without improvement 
in INR.
.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium of 132 on admission, was likely [**2-3**] to 
portal hypertension from cirrhosis.  Low albumin can cause 
dilutional effect . He was on free water fluid restriction at 
1.5 L. 
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Plt ct of 97 on admission. likely due to 
cirrhosis with secondary hypersplenism (large spleen on U/S). 
Was not on heparin gtt during this course of hospital admission.
.
# Anemia - HCT of 36.3 on admission, macrocytic anemia. Likely 
secondary to cirrhosis and anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis 
labs [**10-14**] showed Indirect bili 4.2, Retic % 2.6% (RI 1.6 - 
inadequate), LDH 283 (slightly high), but Haptoglobin 110. Given 
splenomegaly - believe this to be hemolysis in spleen from 
cirrhosis. He was Guaiac negative. He was being transfused for 
hct < 24.
.  
# COPD: continued on nebs
.  
# Psych: He was occasionally agitated (likely component of 
hepatic encephalopathy) with labile mood and expressed feelings 
of hopelessness, depression. No active suicidal ideation, though 
expressed thoughts of ""if only I just didn't wake up"". No HI.  
Was continued on sertraline.
.  
# Pruritus - Derm was consulted. Most likely from 
Hyperbilirubinemia, Uremia. Recommended sarna, hydroxyzine, 
(hydrocortisone tried for pruritus without much effect). Also 
had herpes II positive (back lesion) -> holding on Acyclovir as 
pt in renal failure. Did not consider increasing doxepine to 50 
mg QHS (as recommended by derm) because of renal/hepatic 
toxicity.
. 
# RLE slight warmth and swelling - mostly pitting edema.  RLE 
U/S negative for DVT. Not on heparin because of 
thrombocytopenia.  Continued on pneumoboots, heparin sq  
.  
# Diarrhea - likely from all of his lactulose, but given recent 
low grade fever and multiple Abx, a c diff was negative.  
. 
# PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, heparin sq

     FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest reveal right lower
     lobe hazy opacity likely pneumonia which is more prominent on today's study
     compared to [**2512-10-11**].  The right chest tube sideport appears to be out
     of the chest wall.  There is also fluid tracking along the right chest wall
     which is new compared to before. New elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
     Left CP angle is not included on the present study.  
     
     IMPRESSION:  Worsening right pneumonia and increasing right pleural effusion.
     
     The right-sided chest tube has been partially withdrawn and the sideport is
     outside the thoracic cavity.  Subsequent radiographs demonstrate
     repositioning.

     HISTORY: Left hip pain 
      
     INTERPRETATION:   
      
     Whole body images of the skeleton, dedicated views of the hips, and early and  
     delayed blood pool images were obtained in anterior and posterior projections. 
     No abnormality is detected in the region of the patient's pain.  There is
     symmetric, normal uptake in the hips bilaterally.  A small amount of increased
     uptake is identified in the right anterior lower ribs which is suggestive of
     prior trauma. 
      
     The above described findings are consistent with no evidence for osteomyelitis. 
      
     The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
     excretion. 
      
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence for osteomyelitis.  Small amount of increased uptake in
     the right anterior lower ribs suggests prior trauma.

     PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to study performed six hours prior. 
     A right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position with the side port in
     close proximity to the chest wall.  Small loculated right basilar pneumothorax
     appears slightly smaller in the interval.  There is elevation of the right

     CHEST X-RAY FROM [**10-18**].
     
     HISTORY:  Right-sided pneumonia.  New chest tube to suction.
     
     An AP portable upright chest radiograph is lordotic in projection.  A
     right-sided chest tube placed via the fourth intercostal space remains in
     unchanged position.  The little streak of pneumothorax seen on yesterday's
     study has increased to what appears to be two areas of loculated air along the
     right lower chest wall below the entrance site of the thoracic catheter. 
     Plate-like atelectasis is seen above and below the catheter and there may be
     some fluid in the minor fissure.  The left lung remains clear.  The heart is
     large with suggestion of left ventricular hypertrophy.
     
     CONCLUSION:  Increase in the small, apparently loculated pneumothorax at the
     right base laterally below the entrance site of thoracic catheter.  Recommend
     clinical evaluation of tube positioning and lateral chest radiograph when the
     patient is clinically able.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  55-year-old man with cirrhosis and acute renal failure with MRSA
     empyema.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2507-10-20**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver echotexture is coarse and nodular, but no focal lesions
     are visible.  There is a moderate amount of ascites.  There is no intrahepatic
     biliary ductal dilatation.  The common duct measures 5 mm.  No gallstones are
     seen.  There is edema within the gallbladder wall, consistent with chronic
     disease state.  The portal vein is open, and flow is hepatopetal.  The spleen
     is markedly enlarged, measuring 21 cm.  The right kidney measures 13 cm in
     length.  The left kidney measures 14 cm in length.  Both kidneys are free of
     stone, mass, and hydronephrosis.  The pancreas is not seen due to overlying
     bowel gas.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Cirrhosis and ascites with splenomegaly, without significant
     change since [**2512-10-12**] CT.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Infection requiring IV antibiotics.
     
     PROCEDURE:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 355**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 156**], the
     attending radiologist, present and supervising.  The left upper arm was
     prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Since no suitable superficial veins
     were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of suitable vein.  The left
     brachial vein was patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia with 2 cc
     of 1% lidocaine, the left brachial vein was entered under ultrasonographic
     guidance with a 21-gauge needle.  The 0.018 guidewire was advanced under
     fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based on the markers on the
     guidewire it was determined that a length of 37 cm would be suitable.  The
     PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4-French introducer sheath
     under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava.  The sheath was
     removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final fluoroscopic spot image of the
     chest demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava.  The line is ready
     for use.  The StatLock was applied and the line was heplocked.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 37 cm total length 4-French single
     lumen PICC line with the tip in the SVC, ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Follow up pneumonia.
     
     Comparison to prior chest x-ray of [**2512-10-25**] shows interval insertion of a
     left-sided PICC line terminating in the mid SVC.  There is mild subsegmental
     atelectasis at the left mid lung zone, and linear opacities are present in the
     right mid and lower lung zones.  The right-sided hydropneumothorax is faintly
     visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION: The overall appearance of the chest other than insertion of the
     PICC line does not appear to be significantly changed since the prior chest x-
     ray.
