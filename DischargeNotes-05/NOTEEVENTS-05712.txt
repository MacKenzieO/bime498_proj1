Admission Date:  [**3131-10-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**3131-10-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**3085-4-27**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit/ Medicine, Blumgart
Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus
(with a CD4 count of 175 and a viral load count of greater
than 100,000 as of [**3131-8-19**]) and hepatitis C cirrhosis
(complicated by esophageal varices), and thrombocytopenia who
presented with three episodes of mild variceal bleeding.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on [**3131-10-8**].  He reports three to four episodes of
half a cup of coffee-grounds emesis.  In the Medical
Intensive Care Unit received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD) which showed four cords of grade 3 varices at the lower
third of the esophagus and appearance of the stomach
compatible with portal gastropathy.  Five bands were placed
successfully.  This was per attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

His hematocrit was stable throughout his Medical Intensive
Care Unit course (between 35 and 38), and he did not require
an blood transfusions.  Additionally, Levaquin was started
for a 5-day course for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(SBP) prophylaxis.  Octreotide was also started for a 5-day
course.  In addition, he was treated with nadolol and Bactrim
for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.

The patient received an abdominal ultrasound on [**3131-10-9**] to evaluate for possible portal vein thrombosis/mass in
the liver.  No masses were found.  He had patent portal
veins, a small amount of ascites, cirrhosis, splenomegaly,
edematous gallbladder wall, and cholelithiasis (but without
cholecystitis).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination upon transfer, the patient's vital signs were
stable.  The patient was afebrile, his heart rate was in the
50s to 60s, his blood pressure was 107 to 150/60 to 80, his
respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen
saturation was 98% on room air.  In general, the patient a
was a thin pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  His
sclerae were anicteric.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Cardiovascular examination revealed no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  There was a regular rate and
rhythm.  Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was slight
distended but soft and nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremity examination revealed left leg atrophy.  The
extremities were warm.  No edema.  There were some dry skin
changes.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II
through XII were intact bilaterally.  The patient was alert
and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
upon transfer revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 3.4, his hematocrit was 33.1, and his platelets were 55.
Coagulations revealed the patient's INR was 1.4, and his
partial thromboplastin time of 36.9.  Chemistry-7 revealed
the patient's sodium was 134, potassium was 4.5, chloride was
102, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 10,

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 46-year-old gentleman
with a history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C
cirrhosis, variceal bleed, and status post successful banding
of the varices who was transferred from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit to the Medicine floor.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  ESOPHAGEAL VARICES:  The patient received banding times
five on [**10-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was continued
on his 5-day course of octreotide via continuous intravenous
infusion which ended on the day of discharge.  The patient
was continued on nadolol for portal hypertension.  He was
also continued on sucralfate and by mouth Protonix.  He was
to have a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 7 to 10 days.

2.  SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:
The patient had some ascites on his abdominal ultrasound.
Thus, he received a 5-day course of levofloxacin.

3.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient's
highly active antiretroviral therapy was on hold.  He was to
follow up with Infectious Disease upon discharge for
restarting his highly active antiretroviral therapy, and he
is on Bactrim for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.

4.  CHRONIC PAIN ISSUES:  The patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of OxyContin with oxycodone for
breakthrough pain.

5.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient ambulated and was on
Protonix.  He had an increased INR.

6.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient is a full code.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal varices; status post five bands placed.
2.  Cirrhosis.
3.  Portal hypertension.
4.  Hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
5.  Human immunodeficiency virus.
6.  Thrombocytopenia.
7.  Polysubstance abuse.
8.  Chronic pain.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
1.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
2.  Thiamine 100 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Folic acid 1 mg by mouth every day.
4.  Sucralfate 1 gram by mouth four times per day.
5.  Nadolol 20-mg tablets two tablets by mouth every day.
6.  Bactrim [**MD Number 357**] strength one tablet by mouth once per day.
7.  Pantoprazole delayed release 40 mg by mouth q.12h.
8.  Maalox by mouth as needed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6981**] in Infectious Disease on [**10-23**] at
10:30 a.m. for highly active antiretroviral therapy
discussions.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with an upper
endoscopy the first week of December with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 2082**].
We were unable to actually pin down an appointment for him;
however, the Liver fellow looked into this matter, and the
patient was to call telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1196**] and ask for
[**Doctor Last Name **] to confirm a date and time.  This is very important,
as the patient needs a repeat endoscopy to evaluate his
varices.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  HIV, Hepatitis C, abdominal pain. Follow up lymphadenopathy.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray at patient's request. Comparison is made
     to prior study of [**3131-1-27**].
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear. There are no pleural or
     pericardial effusions.
     
     There is nonspecific wall thickening in the distal esophagus and there is a
     small hiatal hernia. Again seen is hepatomegaly and nodular contour of the
     liver consistent with chronic liver disease.  No definite masses are seen. The
     study did not include an arterial phase.  Again seen is splenomegaly, not
     significantly changed compared to the prior study. Again noted are innumerable
     mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes most prominent in the periportal,
     periceliac, aortocaval and left para aortic regions.  They have not changed in
     size compared to the prior study. The adrenals are normal.  The kidneys are
     normal, there is no hydronephrosis. Small and large bowel loops are not
     dilated. In the right paracolic gutter there is thickening of the mesentery
     adjacent to the cecum which is not significantly changed compared to prior
     study from [**3131-1-17**] and is probably related to post inflammatory changes.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder and ureters are normal. There are
     calcifications in the prostate. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. The
     bones are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Stable cirrhosis and splenomegaly.  In future followup studies a
     multiphasic liver protocol should be requested to optimize detection of focal
     hepatic lesions.
     2) Stable periportal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
     3) Post inflammatory changes in the right paracolic gutter.
