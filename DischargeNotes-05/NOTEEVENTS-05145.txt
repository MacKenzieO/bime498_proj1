     RIGHT FOOT THREE VIEWS [**3059-12-13**].
     
     HISTORY:  75-year-old man with trauma and right lateral foot pain.
     
     FINDINGS:  No prior studies available for comparison.
     
     There are two transverse fracture lines at the base of the fifth metatarsal in
     a transverse orientation, best seen on the oblique radiograph. There is mild
     angulation and cortical thickening of the distal shaft of the fifth
     metatarsal, suggestive of old prior healed fracture.  There is generalized
     osteopenia.  Vascular calcifications are present.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Likely acute fracture at the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Would
     correlate with point tenderness in this region when the patient is examined.
     2.  Angulation and evidence of prior fracture at the distal shaft of the fifth
     metatarsal.
     
     These findings have been given to the assistant to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1426**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8565**]

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  [**3059-12-13**] 1:23 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely acute fracture at the base of the fifth metatarsal. 
Would correlate with point tenderness in this region when the 
patient is examined.
2. Angulation and evidence of prior fracture at the distal shaft 
of the fifth metatarsal.

[**3059-12-14**] ECHO
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly 
dilated. No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is moderately depressed with aneurysmal basal 
to mid infero-lateral and inferior walls. The antero-septum and 
anterior walls appear to contract well (the apex is not well 
seen) No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The 
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic 
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable 
for review) of  [**3059-6-30**], the overall LVEF has probably 
improved and the severity of TR detected has decreased.  

.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3059-12-18**] 12:15 PM
FINDINGS: There is no significant change in the marked 
cardiomegaly or the dual lead pacemaker with defibrillator lead. 
There has been slight interval progression in the right-sided 
patchy alveolar infiltrate that could represent asymmetric edema 
or infection.
IMPRESSION: Slight worsening in right-sided infiltrate.
.
[**12-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
Improving asymmetrical pulmonary edema, left basilar atelectasis 
and left effusion
 
Brief Hospital Course:
75 yom h/o DCM, cardiac arrest and Ventricular tachycardia 
presents to ED after recurrent sudden LOC with ICD shocks ~4 
times. Course complicated by increased O2 requirements. 
.
## Increased Respiratory Requirements: 
Initially admitted to the CCU for the VT/defibrillation. After 
short stay on floor, readmitted to CCU for possible CPAP however 
only needed non-rebreather and was transferred back to the floor 
on nasal cannula.
.
Felt to be due to pneumonia - CAP vs nosocomial PNA. Covered 
with broad spectrum antibiotics. Started on zosyn and 
azithromycin [**12-19**]. Will finish 12 day total course of abx. 
Changed to PO levoquin upon discharge. 
-Continue diuresis with home dose of PO Lasix 60mg QAM. 
-Continued coumadin for goal INR between 2.0 and 3.0.
.
- Patient steadily improved with respect to his O2 requirements 
over the last 4 days of his hospitalization. He was switched 
from a shovel mask to nasal cannula and was comfortable on 3L 
and able to ambulate on this O2 requirement without dyspnea.
Afebrile and blood, urine culture data negative.
.
CARDIAC
## Ischemia:
Continued on [**Last Name (LF) 5902**], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**], Coreg 3.125 BID. Switched to 
captopril 12.5 TID for easier titration while in house and 
resumed on home dose lisinopril 5mg PO QD prior to discharge.
.
## pump: 
Continued coumadin for goal INR [**2-10**] for low EF/hx of afib. 
Continue PO lasix upon discharge. 
.
## rhythm: Slow VT (130's). In ED, VT 130 bpm -> ATP failed -> 
18J shock successful.
Electrophysiology service was consulted and continued to follow 
the patient throughout his hospitalization. He was loaded with 
lidocaine in ED requiring dopamine drip initially. Dopamine drip 
was rapidly weaned off and patient switched from lidocaine drip 
to mexiletine 150mg PO Q8hrs. During hospital stay, no 
recurrence of episodes of VT/syncope. Aggressive lyte repletion 
with potassium goal of 4.5. Serial EKGs were checked and patient 
was monitored on telemetry. Discharged on mexilitine and 
amiodarone. 
- INR goal [**2-10**]
.
## Hypothyroid: Continued synthroid.
.
## Prostrate cancer: s/p TURP on monthly lupron injxns
.
## Left ankle fracture after a fall (2005)/now R metatarsal fx: 
tylenol for pain. Orhtopedics was consulted. No operative 
intervention indicated. Walking boot to assist in ambulation.
.
## CRF: Baseline Cr: 1.6-1.8
.
## FEN
- heart healthy, low Na diet
- aggressive electrolyte repletion -> K goal of 4.5
.
## PPx
- therapeutic on coumadin
- bowel regimen 
.
## Code
- patient was full code in house

     AP CHEST, 8:52 A.M. ON [**12-16**]
     
     HISTORY:  Hypotension and increasing oxygen requirement.
     
     IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**7-1**] and [**3060-1-2**]:
     
     The continuity of the left ventricular lead cannot be assessed because of
     cardiac motion.  The tip is unchanged in its position.  Also unchanged are the
     courses of the intended right atrial transvenous pacer and right ventricular
     transvenous pacer defibrillator lead whose proximal electrode extends from the
     superior vena cava into the right atrium.  Mild interstitial and alveolar
     abnormality in the right lung could represent asymmetric edema, early
     pneumonia, or under the appropriate clinical circumstances, hemorrhage.
     
     There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Very large cardiac
     silhouette is unchanged in size since [**Female First Name (un) 979**].
     
     Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8569**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and I discussed these findings at the time of dictation.

     FINDINGS:  There is no significant change in the marked cardiomegaly or the

     with hypertension with increased O2 requirements.
     
     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3059-12-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Upright single view of the chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is again noted a left chest wall pacemaker with leads in
     stable position.  Apparent increase in left base opacity which most likely
     represents increased pleural effusion with associated lung opacity.  The
     associated lung opacity could represent atelectasis versus consolidation.
     Again noted is relatively increase in density of the right hemithorax which
     could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection. The cardiac
     silhouette remains enlarged but is stable in the interval.  The osseous
     skeletal structures are stable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Stable cardiomegaly.
     2.  Increased opacity in the right hemithorax compared to the left hemithorax
     could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema. It is stable when compared to the
     prior study.
     3.  Stable cardiomegaly.
     4.  Increased left lower lung zone opacity most likely represents interval
     increase in left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or
     consolidation.

     Reason: r/o obstruction                                             
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with                                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o obstruction                                                                 
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Rule out obstruction.
     
     ABDOMEN, TWO VIEWS.
     
     No previous abdominal films are on PACS record for comparison.
     
     There is considerable stool throughout the colon.  No air filled loops of
     dilated bowel are identified to suggest obstruction.  Gas is seen through to
     the level of the rectum.  No free air is identified.  There are scattered
     vascular calcifications including calcification related to the splenic artery.
     Small calcifications over the right lower quadrant may represent calcified
     lymph nodes.  Focal sclerotic density in the left supra-acetabular ilium is
     noted - - in the absence of known malignancy, this likely represents a bone
     island.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Considerable stool.  No findings to suggest obstruction. Blunting
     of the left costophrenic angle and atelectasis/scarring at the right lung
     base noted.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  CHF, nausea, vomiting.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
     
     Left-sided pacemaker is present.  There are three leads, one over the right
     atrium and one over the right ventricle.  The third lead overlies the
     anterolateral wall of the left ventricle.  There is blunting of the left
     costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural effusion or small amount of
     pleural thickening and atelectasis at both bases and in th elingula.  There is
     no CHF, frank consolidation, or effusion. No right-sided effusion is
     identified.  The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.
     
     Am elongated nodular 13-mm density overlies the lower thoracic spine on the
     lateral view and is associated with atelectasis/scarring.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be chronic. Bibasilar
     atelectasis.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
     
     2) Nodular density overlying lower thoracic spine similar to the finding on
     [**3059-12-18**], but more pr ominent on today's exam.  Chest Ct is recommended to
     exclude an underlying malignancy.
