     INDICATION: Back pain.
     
     L SPINE, AP AND LAT: There is anterior wedging of the L1 vertebral body. The
     anterior/superior portion of the vertebral bodies appears minimally displaced
     anteriorly. There is loss of normal disc space height between T12 and L1.
     There is loss of the normal disc space height between L4 and L5 and L5 and S1.
     There is vacuum disc phenomenon at the t12/L1, L4/L5 and L5/S1
     intervertebral levels. Anterior osteophytic spurring is noted between L3 and
     L4. Note is made of extensive calcification of the abdominal aorta without
     evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. The SI joints and bilateral hips are
     unremarkable. Surgical clips are noted just inferior to the pubic symphysis.
     
     IMPRESSION: There is a anterior wedge compression fracture of the L1 vertebral
     body of uncertain age. The appearance of the L1 vertebral body was normal on
     the CT exam dated [**3393-10-17**].

Service:

NOTE:  This is a Discharge Summary Addendum to the previous
Addendum from [**3394-2-24**].

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  The patient had a question of a
right middle lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray noted on [**3394-2-23**].  The patient was started on ceftazidime for presumed
Medical Intensive Care Unit associated pneumonia.

On [**2-24**], the patient underwent a bronchoscopy to
further elucidate the question of a right middle lobe
infiltrate.  It was noted that there was no purulent
discharge or tracheoesophageal fistula on bronchoscopy.  The
patient has remained clinically without pneumonia since his
bronchoscopy.

On [**3394-2-25**], it was decided that the patient most
likely did not have pneumonia and ceftazidime was stopped.
The patient had also been on vancomycin for presumed tracheal
cuff cellulitis.  The area around the cuff was erythematous;
however, it was not warm nor was it indurated.  It most
likely was a result of inflammatory and/or irritative changes
to the skin.  The patient did not have clinical cellulitis
around the tracheal pallor.  The patient's vancomycin was
stopped.

The patient has been weaned off CPAP to a tracheal mask for
durations of up to 16 hours on [**2-24**] and on [**2-25**].
The patient has been tolerating these weanings appropriately.

The patient was started on Mucomyst for secretion to help
decrease the thickness of his secretions.  The patient was
tolerating his current respiratory support well.

The patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation when
rehabilitation is available.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with L1 compression fracture for further
     evaluation.
     
     TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial images of the
     lumbar spine were obtained.  Correlation was made with a lumbar spine CT of
     [**3394-1-15**].
     
     FINDINGS: The L1 vertebra demonstrates deformity with decreased signal in the
     superior portion on T1 and increased signal on T2 and inversion recovery
     images indicating acute/subacute compression.  There is no retropulsion or
     spinal stenosis seen.  The neural arches are intact.
     
     From T11-T12 to L5-S1, the intervertebral discs demonstrate degenerative
     signal.  Mild disc bulging is seen at the L3-L4 level.  At L4-L5, mild disc
     bulging is identified with a small central disc protrusion, without
     significant indentation on the thecal sac.  There is narrowing of the inferior
     portion of both neural foramina without compression of the exiting nerve
     roots.
     
     At L5-S1 level, a small left-sided disc herniation is identified which
     displaces the left S1 nerve root laterally.  No evidence of spinal stenosis or
     foraminal compromise is seen.
     
     In the individualized sacrum, increased signal is identified within the S4
     segment on inversion recovery images with decreased signal on T1 weighted
     images, which is indicative of marrow edema or fracture of the distal sacrum.
     Correlation with patient's point of tenderness is recommended.
     
     The distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1. Acute/subacute mild compression of L1 without retropulsion or
     spinal stenosis, as seen on the CT of [**3394-1-15**].
     
     2. Marrow edema or fracture of distal sacrum at S4 level.
     
     3. Multi-level degenerative changes in the lumbar region with a small left-
     sided disc herniation at L5-S1 level displacing the left S1 nerve root.

     INDICATION: Coronary artery disease. Oxygen desaturation.
     
     Comparison is made to previous study of 2 days earlier.
     
     There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax. Although the patient
     is rotated towards the left, there is still some degree of apparent shift of
     the mediastinal structures separate from rotation. On the right side, note is
     made of a moderate sized pleural effusion which is increased in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Complete opacification of left hemithorax. Although there is a known left
     pleural effusion, the interval increase in opacity with apparent shift of the
     mediastinum towards the left suggests a significant component of collapse of
     the lung, possibly due to mucous plugging. Repeat non-rotated radiographs
     would be helpful to better delineate the degree of mediastinal shift.
     
     2) Moderate sized right pleural effusion.

     INDICATION: Acute respiratory failure, elevated INR and chest x-ray
     demonstrates a large effusion, evaluate for hemothorax vs pleural effusion.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
     lung apices to the lung bases.
     
     COMPARISON:[**3393-10-16**]
     
     CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a massive pleural effusion along the left
     resulting in severe compressive atelectasis of the left lung. There is a small
     amount of residual aerated left lung. The Hounsfield units of this pleural
     effusion measure approximately 13 to 22 Hounsfield units throughout suggesting
     this is predominantly fluid.  There is a moderate size right pleural effusion
     with mild amount of compressive atelectasis in the right lung posteriorly. The
     right pleural effusion has increased slightly in size from the prior exam and
     the left pleural effusion has greatly increased in size.  Again bilateral
     calcified pleural plaques are present.  There is calcification witin the
     coronary arteries and within the aorta.  No axillary or mediastinal
     adenopathy.  A central venous catheter is seen entering from the left internal
     jugular approach with its tip in the superior SVC.  A nasogastric tube is
     present with its tip in the mid portion of the stomach.
     
     On lung windows there is diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout the aerated
     lungs, most severe in the right middle and upper lobes. This could represent
     air trapping in small airways. The nodule in the right middle lobe is
     unchanged.  The minimally aerated left lung is difficult to evaluate.
     
     There is no pericardial effusion. The imaged portions of the upper abdomen are
     unchanged including a left adrenal adenoma.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. Very large left pleural effusion and moderate right pleural effusion.  Both
     pleural effusions measuring less than 20 Hounsfield units indicating that
     these are at least predominantly fluid. A small amount of hemorrhage with
     these collections cannot be excluded.
     2. Compressive atelectasis as described above.
                                                                 (Over)

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  S/P chest tube placement for large left pleural
     effusion.
     
     There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube which courses
     laterally to medially in the lower left hemithorax.  The distal tip overlies
     the left upper quadrant of the abdomen but could be located in the posterior
     portion of the lung base.  Infradiaphragmatic location is not excluded on this
     single projection.
     
     There has been marked decrease in size of a left pleural effusion with a small
     residual pleural effusion remaining laterally.  There is also a loculated left
     basilar pneumothorax.
     
     Lines and tube are in satisfactory position with the exception of coiling at
     the nasogastric tube within the fundus of the stomach.  Cardiac and
     mediastinal contours are within normal limits for supine portable technique.
     There is a partially layering right pleural effusion present.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1)  Decrease in size of left pleural effusion following left-
     sided chest tube placement with residual partially loculated left pleural
     effusion remaining.  There is also a loculated left basilar pneumothorax with
     a single chest tube in place.  Please see comments above regarding chest tube
     location.
     
     2)  Moderate sized partially layering right pleural effusion.

     INDICATION: Oxygen desaturation in patient with congestive heart failure
     history.
     
     An ETT, central venous catheter, NG tube and left sided chest tube remain in
     place. There is increasing pleural fluid in the left hemithorax, and interval
     decreased conspicuity of a loculated basilar pneumothorax. A moderate sized
     right pleural effusion is unchanged.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There is no

     two large pleural effusions.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3394-1-19**]
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images obtained from the chest following the
     administration of IV contrast.
     
     CONTRAST:  100 cc of Optiray were administered secondary to patient history of
     debility.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There
     remains a left loculated effusion associated with atelectasis.  There is also
     a small amount of right pleural fluid.  In the periphery of the lungs more so
     in the right than the left there are ill-defined triangular and nodular
     opacities seen which are thought to represent residual collapse or scarring
     from the evacuation of the bilateral effusions.  There is however a focal 4 mm
     pulmonary nodule seen in the right lower lobe and is stable in appearance when
     compared to the study done [**10-16**].   There is diffuse ground-glass opacities
     seen throughout both lungs with geographic areas of sparring.  There is also
     mild thickening in the septal lines particularly in the lung bases.  This is
     thought to represent findings or interstitial edema however an infectious
     process can't be excluded.  There is bilateral calcified pleural plaques which
     have not changed compared to the prior study.  There is mediastinal sub-cm
     lymphadenopathy which does not meet the CT criteria for pathologic
     enlargement.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen again noted is a left adrenal
     adenoma.  There is a left-sided chest tube and nasogastric tube in place.
     There are no other abnormalities detected in the visualized portion of the
     abdomen.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Small bilateral pleural effusions, with partial loculation of
     the left pleural effusion. These effusions have decreased markedly in size
     compared to the prior study.
     2)  Bilateral calcified pleural plaques unchanged, in keeping with asbestos

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Status post fall on left wrist, buttock and head, patient on
     Coumadin.  Also failure to arouse after weaning sedation.  Evaluate for
     hemorrhage or stroke.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3393-12-2**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of
     normally midline structures or mass effect.  Again there is prominence of the
     ventricles and sulci consistent with brain atrophy, not changed.  There is low
     attenuation in the periventricular areas consistent with small vessel ischemic
     changes.  There are stable old infarctions of the left frontoparietal lobe and
     right occipital lobe.  The orbits and soft tissues are unchanged.  No
     fractures are visualized.  There is soft tissue density in the posterior
     nasopharynx, likely related to patient's intubation.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  No change from the prior
     exam.

     CLINICAL INDICATION:  Left hemithorax opacification.  S/P drainage of pleural
     effusions.
     
     A left lateral decubitus radiograph has been obtained, but is technically
     suboptimal as the majority of the left lung is either excluded from the film
     or obscured by overlying structures.  It is thus not possible to assess for
     layering left pleural effusion on this study.  There is a small amount of
     pleural opacity within the non-dependent right lung which may represent
     a small amount of loculated fluid.  The exam has been scheduled to be re-
     performed at no additional charge to the patient.

     TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with 1 day prior.
     
     FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in stable position, 5.5 cm from the carina.
      There is again a left-sided subclavian catheter, terminating in the
     brachiocephalic, just distal to the brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  There has
     been an interval increase in opacity within the left lung, with shift of the

     of the distal left main stem bronchus. Additionally, there is pleural effusion
     on the left.  No pneumothorax. NG tube remains with the tip curled in the

     Osseous structures are unchanged in appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  1) Partial collapse of left lung, likely due to central mucous
     plug.

     FINDINGS
     
     BRAIN MRI:

     diffusion to indicate acute infarct. There are bilateral chronic occipital
     infarcts identified. Moderate changes of small vessel disease are seen in the
     periventricular region. There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles
     including temporal horns and mild dilatation of sulci. The ventricular
     dilatation is somewhat out of proportion for sulci and clinical correlation is

     FINDINGS: Single frontal view of chest with comparison to [**3394-1-27**]
     approximately six hours prior. Left costophrenic angle is not included on this
     study. There is an endotracheal tube with tip 4.5 cm above the carina. There
     is a left subclavian central line catheter unchanged in position. There is a

     removal of the nasogastric tube. There is a loculated left pleural effusion.
     Additionally, there is a right pleural effusion that is tracking along the
     lateral aspect of the chest cavity. The patient is status post sternotomy. The
     heart size is unchanged in size. There has been interval developments of

     INDICATIONS: Nasogastric tube placement.
     
     Comparison is made to previous films from one day earlier.
     
     PORTABLE CHEST:   A nasogastric tube is present and terminates below the
     diaphragm. There has been interval resolution of gastric distention. An
     endotracheal tube and central venous catheter are unchanged in position.
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval.  An asymmetric
     pattern of alveolar opacities predominantly involving the right lung shows
     interval improvement.  There remains evidence of pleural effusions
     bilaterally, with apparent loculation of the left pleural effusion. Allowing
     for exclusion of part of the right lateral lung from the radiograph, this
     appears unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Improving alveolar pattern in the right lung.
     2.  Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with partial loculation of the left
     pleural effusion.
     3.  Satisfactory placement of nasogastric tube with resolution of gastric
     distention.

     There is evidence of prior median sternotomy.  There is a left-sided
     subclavian central venous catheter in position with its distal tip located
     within the superior SVC.  There is an endotracheal tube in satisfactory
     position.  There is evidence of left ventricular enlargement which is stable
     in comparison to the prior exam.  There is a left-sided pleural effusion with
     an associated area of loculated pleural effusion or pleural thickening along
     the lateral chest wall .  There is a slightly improved appearance of a right-
     sided diffuse pulmonary infiltrate when compared to the prior exam of [**3394-1-28**].
     There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The right hemithorax is partially
     excluded from this examination.  The soft tissues and osseous structures are

Neuro: Pt awake and alert, agitated at times and seemed frustrated that ETT was not coming out. He had no cuff leak when we assessed him for extubation at 2PM. He will remain intubated. Keep HOB elevated at least 30 degrees. We will diurese him further and plan to try to extubate tomorrow. No steroids ordered at this time to try to decrease the edema. Can have small doses of IV ativan Q4hrs PRN which he has had .5mg three times PRN. Has had visitors today, his sister, brother-in-law, neice and wife were all in to visit. He has been turned and positioned Q3-4hrs.

Cardiac: BP higer with periods of agitation. When calm BP 140-150. With agitation BP 170-180. HR 58-70 NSR. He is being diuresed with lasix and is 1500cc's negative fluid balance. Goal was 1L negative. K+ was 3.4 at 9PM and pt is getting 40meq repletion.

Resp: Remains intubated and is resting on the vent for the night on AC 10, TV 500, FIO2 40% with 5cm peep. Last ABG showed pt to be overventillated when getting TV 600 so volumes dropped to 500cc's and I will recheck ABG later tonight. Lungs sounds deminished on the left. 

GI: Tube feeds restarted after we decided to leave him intubated for the night. Promote with fiber at 40cc/hr at ptresent. Goal is 65cc/hr. They can continue through tonight and need to be shut off at 6AM for possible extubation later in the day.

     pleural thickening.  Additionally, there is a linear opacity along the right
     inferolateral chest wall either, either layering effusion or pleural
     thickening.  There is persistent haziness to the right lower lung, likely due
     to layering effusion.  No focal infiltrates are present within the lungs.

     HISTORY:  Intubated patient.
     
     FINDINGS:  Slightly lordotic positioning. Left costophrenic angle excluded
     from film.
     
     Status post CABG. A tracheostomy tube is present, tip immediately above the
     carina, unchanged. An NG tube is present, tip curled in stomach, overlying
     fundus. The right subclavian PICC line is present, tip appears to lie in the
     mid SVC. There is confluent opacification at the right mid zone, with pleural
     thickening at the right chest base and right apex.  There is a probable left
     pleural effusion. There is mild upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
     blurring.  Compared with one day earlier, there has been some interval
     clearing in the right upper and right lower zones and improvement in the CHF
     findings.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Interval improvement in CHF findings and degree of opacification of
     right upper and right lower zones.
     2. Lines and tubes as described. The NG tube is coiled in the fundus as
     described.
     3. No pneumothorax detected.

     Chest xray, single AP supine portable view obtained at 1617 on [**3394-2-15**].
     History not available as computers are off line however EKG leads are in place
     suggesting chest pain and there are diffuse infiltrates and effusions.
     
     A tracheostomy tube is present, tip immediately above the carina, unchanged.
     An NG tube is present, tip obscured due to under penetration, but probably
     beneath diaphragm there is considerable opacification of the right lung, which
     at least in part likely relates to a layering pleural effusion. There is a
     small to moderate left pleural effusion. In addition, there is diffuse
     prominence and blurring of interstitial markings.
     
     IMPRESSION: Bilateral right greater than left effusions, probably with CHF.
     Underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Overall, findings are
     similar to those of one day earlier. Probable right sided PICC line which is
     not well demonstrated on this film.

     INDICATION:  Worsening oxygenation, history of hemothorax and effusion.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior exam of [**3394-2-18**].
     
     FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube, NG tube, and right-sided PICC line are seen in
     stable position.  The patient is status-post prior CABG.  There is no
     pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal borders are unchanged.  The pulmonary
     vasculature is normal.  There are curvilinear densities at the left
     costophrenic angle, consistent with scarring and/or atelectasis, with possible
     small left effusion.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent
     with residual pleural effusion.  Also, a small amount of patchy opacity is
     seen in the right lower lung zone, unchanged from prior exam.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Overall unchanged appearance to findings compared to prior exam.

MICU NPN 3PM-11PM:
Neuro: Pt slept on/off this evening. Wakes easily to his name being called and appears alert and oriented. He assists with turns and nods head to questions. He actually was more interactive tonight than I have seen him in the past. Able to use oral suction independently. He has been left unrestained and has been very appropriate, not pulling lines/tubes.

CV: HR too low to give him his sotolol and lopressor tonight. Both held this evening. HR was as low as 48 while asleep. Now is running 58-68 SB-NSR. No VEA. BP 110-140's.

Resp: Put back on the vent at 3PM. Did 5hrs on trach collar! Currently on PSV 10 with 5cm peep. SRR 15-28. TV 250-380. Requires frequent suctioning for copious amts foul smelling tan secretions via the ETT. Sats 92%-98% most of the shift.

GI: Tube feeds advanced to goal of 75cc/hr. Residuals checked at 8PM were up to 70. This was refed and tube feeds continued. No stool. GI aspirate had a old blood clot noted mixed in with undigested tube feeds. No further signs of bleeding noted. Repeat hct sent at 10PM. Foley with balloon inflated with 20cc's remains in his left nares to tamponade the bleeding source. This will remain in place until Monday when it is planned to be taken out.

GU: UO 25-45cc/hr via foley.

Endo: Glucose stable, no coverage required. Given 15u NPH at 6PM as ordered.

Social: Son came by to visit. Update given. Pt's sister [**Name (NI) 7451**] also called and notified that he was stable. Plan is for pt to go to rehab once the nose bleeding issue is resolved. This will hopefully come to pass early next week.

     INDICATION:  Right middle lobe infiltrate. Check status following tracheostomy
     for respiratory failure.
     
     FINDINGS:  AP supine views. Comparison study dated [**3394-2-24**].  There has now been
     partial resolution of the ill-defined pulmonary infiltrates in the right mid
     and lower zones. However, some minor infiltrates are again noted at both bases
     and there is again evidence of blunting of the left costophrenic angle. The
     heart shows moderate left ventricular enlargement. There is evidence of a
     prior CABG surgical procedure. The pulmonary vessels show minimal upper zone
     redistributio but its significance is unclear since the patient is supine.
     Slight LV failure cannot be excluded. The tracheostomy tube remains in
     satisfactory position.  The small right sided pleural effusion is not changed.
     
     IMPRESSION: Some resolution of pulmonary infiltrates on the right side.
     Residual bilateral effusions. Slight left heart failure may be present.

     posterior pharyngeal bleed, now with increased bloody secretions from the
     oropharynx, rule out hemothorax or pneumonia.
     
     SINGLE VIEW CHEST: Comparison is made to the study of [**3394-2-25**]. The
     tracheostomy is in appropriate position. The patient is status post CABG.
     Again noted is moderate left ventricular enlargement. There is a right- sided
     pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion. There is now increased
     opacity overlying the lateral aspect of the mid and lower zones on the right.
     It is not clear whether this represents pulmonary consolidation or loculated
     pleural fluid. There is prominence of the pulmonary vessels with upper zone
     redistribution, consistent with CHF.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, unchanged.
     2. Increased opacity in the mid and lower zones on the right. It is not clear
     whether this represents a loculated pleural effusion or a pulmonary
     consolidation such as pulmonary hemorrhage. A lateral view would be helpful if
     the patient can tolerate it. Alternatively, a CT could be considered.
     3. Findings consistent with CHF.

Nursing Progress Note.

RESP: Pt received this AM on CPAP/PS of 5/5 c 50% FiO2 in place.  Pt's sat this AM noted to be in the high 80's/low 90's, pt was therefore bagged/lavaged for moderate amounts of thick tannish sec per ETT and HOB was raised to 45 degrees.  (Tube feed gastric drainage also noted around trach dressing wound site -- tube feeds d/c'ed.)  LS were fairly clear in upper apices s/p sxn'ing c diminished BS in bases.  Team notified of poor resolution to low sat, the pt was subsequently med c 80mg IV Lasix and was moved from bed to chair.  Sat has slowly improved c values hovering in the 92-94% range.  The pt presently requires sxn'ing Q2-3 hours.  The pt RR has been in the teens all day c TVol's in the 300-500 range.  Of note the pt did very poorly on a spontaneous breathing trial this AM.  The pt has not appeared dyspneic or SOB today.  Bite block removed, the pt has not been biting the ETT since.  AM RISB = 34.  Will keep pt on CPAP/PS of 5/5 c 50% FiO2 @ this time and cont to monitor resp fxn closely.

MS: The pt exhibits a waxing/[**Doctor Last Name **] mentation c periods in which he will follow commands, MAE, and nod head appropriately to yes/no question.  However, at other times the pt will be virtually unresponsive, will not follow commands and appears disoriented (stairs straight ahead and will not avert his gaze unless spoken to loudly).  UE soft writs restraints in place to protect ETT.  PERRL.  No psychomimetic agents admin today.  Pt oriented to person, time, place to improve mentation.  The pt was OOB to chair times five hours today c good tol.  The pt was returned to his bed after the pt indicated that he was tired of sitting in his chair and wished to return to his bed.  Presently, the pt is sleeping soundly in NAD.

CV: HDSA, NSR c occasional PVC's.  As noted above, the pt was med c 80mg IV Lasix to increase UO c fair results -- he is presently net out 500ml.  +2 Peripheral edema remains in place.  SQ Epogen started today per Team order.  ISS revised today to achieve tighter cntl of FS.  SBP maintained within 140-180 values as desired by team for optimal renal perfusion.

GI: High residuals noted via PEG today (120-200) and therefore tube feeds d/c'ed.  Pt also noted to have gastric tube feeds exuding from trach stoma site -- surgical team has requested that the pt's TF be d/c'ed for 48-72 hours to protect wound site.  Surgery team also feels that the wound is healing nicely @ this time and will perform a Bronchoscopy to visualize the pts esophagus/trachea to R/O a trachael - esophageal fistulae (although it is more probably that the pt simple aspirated gastric secretions).  Pt is presently NPO x meds.  IV Reglan provided to improve GI motility PRN.  The pt has had two loose BM's today.  Abd is obese, +BS, NT to palpation.

     CLINICAL INDICATION: Tracheostomy tube revision. Respiratory failure.
     
     An endotracheal tube remains in place. It is in satisfactory position. There
     is a new right internal jugular vascular catheter terminating in the lower
     SVC. A PICC line remains in place.
     
     The heart is mildly enlarged, and there is persistent vascular engorgement.
     There is a persistent congestive heart failure pattern, but there is no
     increasing alveolar opacity in the right lung which is asymmetric compared to
     the left. There is a moderate sized right pleural effusion and a small left
     pleural effusion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. New vascular catheter in satisfactory position, with no new pneumothorax.
     
     2. Increasing asymmetric alveolar pattern in right lung superimposed upon
     previously noted typical changes of pulmonary edema. Differential diagnosis
     includes asymmetric pulmonary edema versus superimposed aspiration event.

     INDICATION: 69 year old male with endstage renal disease needs tunneled
     dialysis catheter.
     
     RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 291**]
     [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1078**] with attending Radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1078**] being present for the
     entire procedure.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and the benefits were explained to the
     patient and consent was obtained.
     
     The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table. The right neck and
     upper chest were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Under sonographic
     guidance and local anesthesia, the right internal jugular vein was accessed
     using 21 gauge needle and a .018 wire was placed into the superior vena cava
     using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture
     sheath. Subcutaneus tunnel was made from the IJ entry site to the right upper
     chest wall and a 14 French 23 cm tip to cuff dialysis catheter was placed
     through the tunnel. Using fluoroscopic guidance, a .035 guidewire was placed
     through the sheath into the inferior vena cava.  The IJ entry site was dilated
     using increasing sized dilators.  A 14 French peel- away sheath was placed
     over the wire into the superior vena cava.  The 14 French dialysis catheter
     was placed through the peel-away sheath into the SVC with its tip in the
     proximal right atrium. A chest film was obtained documenting appropriate
     positioning.  The catheter was flushed and secured to the skin using 0-Prolene
     stitch. The neck wound was closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  The
     catheter was flushed and locked using heparin solution.
     
     The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.
     
     IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 14 French right IJ access tunneled
     dialysis catheter, ready for use.

     Single view of the chest was compared to a prior study dated [**3394-4-4**].
     
     The right-sided dialysis catheter is unchanged. The ET tube is 5 cm above the
     carina. The balloon appears slightly larger than the tracheal lumen,
     suggesting overinflation. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is vascular
     congestion, which is unchanged. The asymmetric right upper quadrant opacity is
     unchanged. There is bilateral pleural effusions (moderate on the right).
     
     IMPRESSION:   No significant change in comparison to the previous study.
     
     Findings consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema vs. superimposed
     aspiration in the right upper lobe.
     
     The cuff appears slightly wider than the tracheal lumen. Clinical correlation
     is recommended.

     3.8 cm above the carina. Right dual lumen central venous catheter terminates
     in the distal SVC. Right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. There is air
     adjacent to the trachea to the left, at the level of the clavicular head.
     Correlate clinically. There is patchy bilateral alveolar opacification,
     probably representing edema of ARDS. There are bilateral pleural effusions,
     left greater than right. Several small lucencies are noted at the left
     inferolateral lung base. This may represent cavitary pneumonia. A focal
     abscess cannot be excluded. Patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy.

     Status post tracheostomy with necrosis and tracheostomy revision, on
     ventilator, ETT exchange, evaluate for interval changes in thorax.
     
     FINDINGS:  The AP single chest view does not include left lung field.  The
     right hemithorax is seen entirely.  The film is analyzed in direct comparison
     with the next-preceding similar AP single view examination dated [**3394-4-8**] (two days interval).  The previous ETT has been replaced with a
     tracheostomy cannula.  The previously present dual-lumen central venous
     catheter is in unchanged position and the same holds for the right-sided PICC
     line terminating just about at the level of the carina.  Position of metallic
     sternal sutures and bypass ring markers indicates that patient is slightly
     rotated towards the left now.  Paying attention to these positional changes,
     there is no conclusive evidence for any significant interval change during the
     last two days.  Thus, diffuse perivascular haze is noted and pleural densities
     with blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus persist.  There is no
     evidence of new parenchymal densities nor significantly increased congestive
     pattern.  No evidence for apical pneumothoraces or large hematoma in the area
     of tracheostomy revision.

     INDICATION: Tracheal necrosis. Clinical concern for right lung consolidation.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST: Compared to the exam one day previously, there has been
     significant interval enlargement of a rounded left upper lobe mass. Given the
     rapid onset, this may represent pulmonary hemorrhage versus pneumonia,
     particularly pneumococcal. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, which
     are not significantly changed. Compared to the exam one day previously, there
     has been slight improvement of pulmonary edema and upper zone vascular
     redistribution. The heart is enlarged. Patient status post CABG. Tracheostomy
     is in good position. Dual lumen right-sided central venous catheter projects
     its tips at the cavoatrial junction.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Rapid onset left upper lobe consolidation or mass is concerning for
     pulmonary hemorrhage or rapidly developing pneumonia such as pneumococcal
     pneumonia. This finding was phoned emergently to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 9244**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9245**], at the
