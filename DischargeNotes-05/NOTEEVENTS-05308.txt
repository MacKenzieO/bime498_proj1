Cardiac Catheterization
TEE Cardioversion
Pacemaker/Defibrillator Placement

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 4682**] is a 83 year old woman with a history of CAD s/p cath 
[**12-12**] with stent LCX and RCA, ESRD on HD for the past 5 weeks, 
Hep B cirrhosis and COPD who is transferred from [**Hospital1 6204**] and Rehab Center with STEMI.  
.  
She was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 83**] from [**1-7**] to [**1-21**] with 
left lower lobe pneumonia and ESRD and started on HD. She was 
discharged to [**Hospital1 236**] for treatment of her pneumonia. 
Over the past week, she was noted to have increasing cough with 
white sputum production, bronchospasm, shortness of breath and 
orthopnea. She was treated with IV solumedrol and biaxin which 
was changed to prednisone 60 mg on [**2-13**]. She was continued on 
levaquin and vancomycin and nebulizers. She was seen by 
pulmonary and they felt her wheeze and sob were due to CHF 
rather than COPD exacerbation. On [**2-13**] they were unable to 
complete dialysis due to clotted access catheter. On [**2-13**] she was 
started on 100 mg IV Lasix bid and zaroxyln with good response. 
ECG done [**2-13**] elevation in the inferior leads which 
were new compared to ECG from [**2776-1-21**]. ECG was repeated on [**2-16**] 
and showed similar ST elevation that was slightly decreased. CK 
was 115, CK-MB was 41 and TnI was 14.88. She was transfered to 
the [**Hospital1 83**] ED for further evaluation. Of note her aspirin was 
discontinued one week prior to admission due to platelet count 
of 63000.  
.  
In the ED the patient reported that she has been having chest 
pressure for several days. The pressure is worse with 
inspiration and expiration and worse with cough. She has had 
cough and shortness of breath for one month. She reported [**5-19**] 
chest pain, radiating to her right shoulder. In the ED she 
received aspirin 325 mg, heparin 5000 bolus and 300 mg plavix. 
She was brought to the cath lab.  
.  
Cath: findings notable for mod LMCA calcification, LAD mod calc 
with diffuse disease, LCX with non dom vessel, RCA occ mid 
segment with L --> R collaterals, RCA lesion dilated and then 
Taxus stent x 5.  
.  
Admitted to CMED.  
.  
ROS: Reports 5/10 chest pain that is slightly better than prior 
to cath. Worse with inspiration and expiration. She feels short 
of breath and feels like she has sputum that she cannot get up. 
She denies abdominal pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting. Feels 
her legs are restless.  

 
Past Medical History:
1. COPD  
2. Hepatitis B cirrhosis  
3. Low back pain s/p laminectomy  
4. Chronic renal insufficency - baseline Cr 2.9-3.3-> Being 
followed by renal (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4457**]) who feels this may be either 
hypertensive vascular disease or membranous glomerulonephritis 
secondary to hepatitis  
5. rheumatoid arthritis  
6. chronic renal insufficiency  
7. recurrent urinary tract infections  
8. right total knee replacement

COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system 
with 
calcified LMCA but no critical stenosis. LAD had some moderate 
diffuse 
disease. LCX was a non-dominant vessel without critical lesions. 
RCA was 
totally occluded through its mid-vessel course with some distal 
flow to 
the PDA territory via L->R collaterals. 
2. Left ventriculography was deferred given CRI. 
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated right-sided 
filling 
pressures consistent with volume overload. There was mild to 
moderate 
pulmonary hypertension. 
4. The acute total occlusion of the mid RCA was predilated with 
1.5 X 
6mm Sprinter and 2.5 X 30mm maverick balloons, stented with 2.5 
X 20mm, 
3.0 X 20mm, 3.0 X 15mm and 3.5 X 32mm Taxus stents and post 
dilated with 
3.0 X 15mm NC ranger balloon with lesion reduction from 100% to 
0%. The 
final angiomgram showed TIMI flow with no dissection and no 
embolisation. (see PTCA comments) 
5. R femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6Fr angioseal. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Normal ventricular function. 
3 Successful stenting of the mid RCA lesion in the setting of an 
Acute 
inferior STEMI 
[**2776-2-19**] CXR:
HISTORY: Shortness of breath and cough. Recent MI. Please 
evaluate for CHF versus pneumonia.

AP upright and left lateral views of the chest show interval 
clearing of pleural effusion seen on the patient's prior 
portable study from [**2776-1-14**]. No focal consolidation is 
seen to suggest pneumonia and the pulmonary vasculature is not 
congested. Moderate cardiomegaly appears stable and soft tissue 
mass at the right upper mediastinum has been shown to be 
vascular on previous cross sectional imaging studies. Tunneled 
dialysis tubing is seen with distal tip at the level of the 
right atrium and the proximal tip at the level of the SVC/right 
atrial junction. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen in the 
arch of the aorta.

CONCLUSION: No CHF or pneumonia.
[**2776-2-17**] Echo:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or  
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left  
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a  
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left  
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary 
to  
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. An apical intracavitary 
gradient is  
identified. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. 
There is no  
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal. Right  
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3)  
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic  
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There  
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The left  
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
tricuspid valve  
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. 
 
  
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of [**2776-1-14**], inferobasal hypokinesis is now present.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old woman with history of CAD, hep B cirrhosis, ESRD on 
HD, recent pneumonia, s/p sTMEI with stent who developed post MI 
AF. S?p DCCV with brief stay in the CCU for observation. 
Bradycardia concerning for sick sinus syndrome. 
.

.
1. s/p STEMI: patient experienced an ST Elevation MI.  the 
patient tolerated catheterization well, and was pain free 
afterwards.  She is s/p RCA stents with continued STE on ECG, 
which gradually resolved, evolving into q waves.  Patient was 
started on usual post-MI care with ASA, BB, statin, plavix, and 
ACEIs.  Patient does have diastolic [**Last Name (LF) 6205**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 50%.  Since 
diuresis would have been ineffective (patient has ESRD), HD was 
used to take off fluid
.
c. Rhythm: patient was in NSR post MI.  On [**2-18**], she 
spontaneously converted to afib with RVR.  She required IV 
diltiazem and IV lopressor to control her rate.  She was also 
started on anti-coagulation with heparin and coumadin.  The 
decision was made to cardiover the patient.  s/p DCCV, in sinus, 
cont to hold BB to observe rate for 24 hrs.  Patient then became 
bradycardic to 40s, and was transferred to CCU with a temp 
pacing wire. TEE showed: No evidence for intracardiac ( and in 
particular left atrial )thrombus. Severely hypokinetic right 
ventricle.  HR stable in the CCU, but did have one episode of 
atrial tachycardia, ?wandering pacemaker, followed by a pause, 
junctional escape rhythm and return of sinus rythym. Tolerated 
full course of HD prior to transfer. Transferred back to CMED 
for monitoring and placement. Pt felt ok. Has some difficulty 
breathing, + cough but unable to get much up. She developed a 
small left forarm bleed from an IV.  Then, the decision was made 
in consult with EP to place a DDD pacemaker.  Pt was given 2 
doses of vancomycin pre and post-procedure.  The procedure was 
w/o complications.  Post-pacemaker, the patient's HR alternated 
between 60s (paced) and 100s (afib).  BB blocker was adusted to 
control HR. The patient has an appointment to follow up in 
Device clinic.
.
2. ESRD on HD: renal consult was called, HD was initiated.  
Initially had some difficulty due to hypotension associated with 
atrial fibrillation.  Post DCCV+pacemaker placement, the patient 
tolerated HD ok.  The patient is to have hemodialysis while at 
rehab on a schedule of HD MWF.  All meds were renally dosed, and 
the patient was continued on sevelamer, and nephrocaps.  Patient 
needs her eletctrolytes to be checked 3 times a week with 
dialysis.  Electrolytes should be adjusted and sevelamer dosing 
(phosphate binder) should be adjusted according to phosphate 
levels. 
.
4. Pneumonia: s/p levofloxacin for 14 days. The patient 
initially had some cough, but clear CXR, afebrile.  Expectorants 
were given, the patient continued to remain afebrile, and 
symptoms improved.
.
5. COPD: s/p steroid taper.  The patient's lungs were without 
wheezes.  We continued inhalers, nebs PRN.
.
6. UTI: patient was discovered to have VRE on [**2-19**] cx. Of note, 
the patient was started on vancomycin for ""urinary infection"" 
while at rehab, though there was no clear documentations 
regarding what was cultured from that urine.  The patient was 
started on  linezolid for 14 days, started on [**2-23**].
.
7. Thrombocytopenia: Chronic and likely related to cirrhosis. 
Albumin only slightly decreased and INR normal. will monitor 
while on heparin, platelets did not drop greater than 50%, 
stayed stable. 
.
8. Anti-coagulation.  Patient has atrial fibrillation and was 
started on anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin.  Heparin 
was d/c'd and patient was therapeutic on her INR throughout her 
hospital stay.  During the last day, the patient was 
supratherapeutic on her INR, but here was no evidence of 
bleeding, mental status changes or agitation.  PO Vitamin K was 
given. At rehab, coumadin needs to be HELD for [**2776-2-28**] and 
[**2776-2-29**].  PT/INR needs to be re-checked on [**2776-2-28**].  If INR > 7, 
5mg of PO vitamin K should be given, and PCP needs to be 
notified for further guidance (and coumadin dosing needs to be 
held).

                                     FINAL REPORT
     CHEST PA AND LATERAL FROM [**2-17**]
     
     HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and cough.  Recent MI.  Please evaluate for CHF
     versus pneumonia.
     
     AP upright and left lateral views of the chest show interval clearing of
     pleural effusion seen on the patient's prior portable study from [**2776-1-14**].  No focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia and the pulmonary
     vasculature is not congested.  Moderate cardiomegaly appears stable and soft
     tissue mass at the right upper mediastinum has been shown to be vascular on
     previous cross sectional imaging studies.  Tunneled dialysis tubing is seen
     with distal tip at the level of the right atrium and the proximal tip at the
     level of the SVC/right atrial junction.  Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is
     seen in the arch of the aorta.
     
     CONCLUSION:  No CHF or pneumonia.

CCU 1900-0700
RESP:- Remains on nasal cannula, 3 Litres, Sa02 96-99%, RR18-30s and regular. Bilateral air-entry heard to all lung fields, very coarse throughout. Strong cough, minimal expectorated. Sputum sample sent.

CV:- Monitored in A fib/Sinus Bradycardia overnight, no ectopics seen. Had a 5.29 second pause, prior to leaving for the floor, decided to keep her on unit overnight. Asymptomatic during pause. SBP 98-120 overnight, held captoril due to hypotension. Recommenced IV Heparin due to A fib, initially at 1350 units/hr. PTT due at 0630. Rt groin site appears satisfacotry.

NEURO:- A&O X3, a little hard of hearing. Given Zolpidem at 2200, but did not work, stated she felt anxious at midnight about her heart and everything that had happened yesturday, asked for Lorazepam, given with good effect. Moving all four limbs well within limits. Shuffling around the bed. Resless legs continue.

GU:- Foley catheter draing small amounts of yellow dark urine. Am labs to be taken at 0630. ? for HD today.

GI:- Attempted to eat evening meal but vomitted striaght after. Given dolasetron mesylate with good effect, managed to eat pears. Taken good amounts of oral fluids. Abdomen soft/distended, bowel sounds heard.

ID:- Afebrile overnight, small amount of sputum expectorated from chest. Line sites satisfactory.

SKIN:- Shuffling around in bed, (restless legs) turning self/assistance also given. Freshen up [**Doctor Last Name **] given after vomitted.

FAMILY:- Son visited, and updated on the days events. will call tomorrow, no others enquires as yet from other family overnight.

PLAN:- To continue monitor heart rate and rhythm, for atropine if become bradycardic, pacing pads insitu. DNR/DNI, but we are to treat bradycardias as this is iatrogenic due to high/freequent does of metoprolol. ? can go to the floor later today. for AM labs/PTT due at 0630. Fluid restriction of 1200cc. To continue to give full explination of care to Mrs [**Known patient lastname 4405**] and family.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Pneumothorax?Lead Position?

                                     FINAL REPORT
     REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax and lead position after
     insertion of the pacemaker.
     
     PA and lateral chest x-ray were performed and compared to the previous study
     from [**2776-2-17**].
     
     The  right subclavian double-channel catheter is inserted with its tip
     projecting over the area of cavoatrial junction. The pacemaker device is
     inserted in the left hemithorax with two leads, the first lead is ending
     within the right atrium and the second one within the right ventricle.  No
     evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is slightly enlarged with
     evidence of left atrial enlargement.  The aorta is tortuous and calcified, but
     with no evidence of focal dilatation.  There is a new opacification of the
     left lung base and costophrenic angle which most probably represent small
     amount of pleural fluid which is best seen on the lateral view.
     
     No evidence of congestive heart failure is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Normal position of the pacemaker leads.  No evidence of pneumothorax is
     present.
     
     2.  New left lower lobe opacity which most probably represents pleural fluid.
