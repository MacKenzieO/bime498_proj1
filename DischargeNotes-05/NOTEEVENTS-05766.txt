Admission Date:  [**2503-9-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2503-9-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2429-11-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and depression,
who presents with decreased mental status and fevers to 102.
The patient apparently was in her usual state of health until
the day prior to admission.  She was found on the morning of
admission by her husband to be unresponsive in bed, with
empty pill bottles near her head.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Room by ambulance
and noted to be febrile to 102 on arrival.  Prescription
medications at home included Paxil, lithium, Prednisone,
Nardil and verapamil.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
hemodynamically stable, however, was noted to be rigid on
examination.  Concern was for serotonin syndrome.  The
patient was then treated with charcoal and sorbitol,
paralyzed and intubated.

Toxicology consultation was obtained with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further management.  Of note, the husband states
that the patient has been depressed, and the drug overdose
likely represents a suicide attempt.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  2.  Atrial fibrillation.  3.  Hypothyroidism.  4.
Depression versus bipolar disorder.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil, Synthroid, ?Prednisone,
Nardil, verapamil, lithium and Colace.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and resides with her
husband in [**Name2 (NI) 486**].  She was educated at [**Location (un) 7098**] and
previously worked as a line reader at [**Location (un) 3748**]-[**Last Name (un) 7099**].  She
has a remote tobacco history and quit 20 years ago.  She has
occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination prior to
paralysis, the patient had a temperature of 102, pulse 100,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/70 and oxygen saturation
100%.  General:  Elderly female in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic,
pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, trachea
midline.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, no S3, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border, no
rubs.  Pulmonary:  Bilateral coarse upper airway sounds, no
wheezes or rales noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Cool to touch, pulses intact, no edema.
Neurologic examination:  Lethargic and unresponsive, upper
extremities rigid with slightly flexed forearm posture, lower
extremities rigid with extension and bilaterally upgoing
toes, unable to evaluate sensation.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 7.1, hematocrit
34.2, platelet count 336,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.5,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose
109, prothrombin time 12, partial thromboplastin time 24, INR
1.1, lactate 1.7, free calcium 1.15, lithium 1.1,
acetaminophen 25, and serum toxicology screen positive for
opiates.  AST was 1,243, ALT 455, alkaline phosphatase 132,
lipase 104, calcium 8.8, phosphorous 3.3, magnesium 2.1, CPK
326, vitamin B12 701, folate 7.3, serum osmolarity 298, TSH
2.1, free T4 0.9, digoxin level 2.1, rechecked on [**2503-9-8**] 0.3, and lithium 1.3 on admission, rechecked on [**2503-9-6**] 0.2.

On transfer, white blood cell count was 7.9, hematocrit 30.6,
platelet count 335,000, glucose 90, BUN 17, creatinine 0.5,
sodium 145, potassium 3.9, chloride 106, bicarbonate 32, ALT
91, AST 20, alkaline phosphatase 89, CK 76, total bilirubin
0.2, calcium 8.4, phosphorous 3.8 and magnesium 1.8.  Head CT
scan on admission showed evidence of white matter disease, no
evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.  Chest x-ray the day
prior to transfer showed no evidence of consolidation of
effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax; there was evidence of
osteopenia with no evidence of vertebral compression
fractures in the thoracic spine.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 74 year old female with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and depression, who
presents with decreased mental status and fever to 102,
having overdosed on her prescription medications.

1.  Overdose:  The patient was found unresponsive at home and
brought to the Emergency Room, where she was responsive only
to painful stimuli.  She was then paralyzed, sedated and
intubated for airway protection.  Given the multiple empty
bottles of medications near her at the time she was found,
this is likely a complicated overdose.  A toxicology screen
was positive for opiates with an elevated acetaminophen
level.  She was given 1 mg of Narcan.  She was given charcoal
with sorbitol, followed by Mucomyst, which was continued
every four hours over the first 72 hours during her hospital
course.

Toxicology consultation was obtained was obtained with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient was given a single dose of
N-acetylcysteine.  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for further management.  This is a complicated drug
overdose with likely serotonin syndrome, precipitated by
Paxil and MAO inhibitors and complicated by other
medications, given the patient's presentation.  Her liver
function tests, APAP and lithium levels were initially
elevated, but were followed and trended downward.  The
patient was extubated without difficulty on [**2503-9-6**].

2.  Psychiatry:  Given the patient's history of depression
and suicide attempt, a psychiatric consultation was
requested.  The patient had a one-to-one observer out of the
Intensive Care Unit and all psychotropic medications were
held.  Her delirium continued to progressively resolve post
extubation.  She continued to have a blunted affect and
depressed mood, feeling bad about attempting to end her life.
She denied any further suicidal ideation, but was still
clearly depressed.  It was felt that the patient would
require inpatient psychiatric hospitalization after her
medical issues were resolved.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient's transaminases were
elevated secondary to acetaminophen toxicity and were
followed, with downward trend.  She was noted to have guaiac
positive stools and gastroenterology was consulted regarding
this issue in the setting of a complicated overdose.  They
did not feel that she had any signs of any significant
gastrointestinal bleed and recommended a colonoscopy as an
outpatient.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient was paralyzed and intubated on
arrival for airway protection.  She was extubated without
difficulty on [**2503-9-6**].  Post extubation, she had
oxygen saturations in the low 90s.  A chest x-ray was noted
to be without evidence of consolidation or infiltrates.  The
patient was encouraged to use her incentive spirometer, with
improvement in her oxygen saturations.

5.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation.  Her digoxin level was noted to be elevated on
arrival and digoxin was held during the course of her
hospitalization.  Her digoxin level was subsequently
decreased.  She will need to be restarted on her digoxin
sometime in the future.  Her CKs were elevated on admission,
thought to be secondary to her paralysis and drug overdose.
Her CK/MB was not elevated and her electrocardiogram showed
no ischemic changes.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be transferred to an inpatient
psychiatric unit for further treatment.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Levoxyl 0.025 mg p.o.q.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.p.r.n.
