Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 38-year-old
gentleman, who was positive for EtOH, fell, and had a
witnessed seizure.  He was taken to an outside hospital, was
intubated, and head CT at the outside hospital revealed a
right sided bilateral frontal contusions and interparenchymal
hemorrhage.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 74**] for further management.

He was admitted to the Trauma ICU.  He was agitated and
confused.  On post hospital day #2, he went into DTs.  Was
medicated with large amounts of Ativan and Haldol.  He was
moving all extremities, but not following commands at that
point.

On post hospital day #3, he was opening his eyes to voice,
was oriented to hospital.  EOMs were full.  Face is
symmetric.  He was following commands.  His IPs were full.
He had full strength in all of his extremities.  He continued
to be monitored for DTs and was being weaned from his large
doses of Ativan and Haldol.  Had a repeat head CT on hospital
day #2, which was stable with bilateral frontal contusions.
He was in a hard collar for suspected cervical spine injury,
however, was not awake enough to clear clinically.  AP and
lateral films showed no evidence of fractures.

Transferred to the regular floor on [**3074-10-14**] with sitter.
He was cleared clinically from his hard collar on [**3074-10-16**].
He was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and
found to be safe for discharge home.  He will need to
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5709**] in one month with a repeat
head CT.  He had no complaints of headache or pain prior to
discharge.

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Metoprolol 50 p.o. b.i.d.
3. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4h. prn for pain.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient's condition was stable at
the time of discharge.

     INDICATION:  Trauma.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvic performed following IV
     administration of 150 cc of Optiray. Nonionic contrast due to patient's
     debility. No comparison studies are available.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a minimal amount of atelectasis or
     consolidation at both lung bases. There is evidence of diffuse low attenuation
     of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration. The liver is otherwise normal
     in contour with no evidence of hepatic mass or biliary ductal dilatation. The
     gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal in appearance.
     There are multiple small periportal and peripancreatic lymph nodes none of
     which pathologic size by CT criteria. Some of these nodes are densely
     calcified in the peripancreatic region and periportal region.  There is no
     free air or free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis. There is no abnormal
     dilatation or wall thickening within large and small bowel.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distal ureters are normal in caliber. The urinary
     bladder, prostate, and rectum are normal in appearance.
     
     BONE WINDOWS: There are fractures of the 10th through 12th ribs on the left of
     indeterminate age. There is no evidence of significant hematoma surrounding
     these rib fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Uncomplicated rib fractures of indeterminate age from the level of T10
     through 12 on the left.
     2) Nonspecific calcified small peripancreatic and periportal lymph nodes.
     3) Fatty liver.
     4) No other acute traumatic abnormality identified.

     Allowing for portable semierect technique, heart size is upper limits of
     normal. There is slight LV configuration of the heart and note is made of mild
     tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The lungs demonstrate a focal linear opacity
     at the left base but are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
     is evident. Although no acute displaced rib fracture is identified, note is
     made of exclusion of the extreme lateral right rib cage from the radiograph,
     limiting assessment of this region. Incidental note is made of a healed
     fracture of the distal right clavicle.
     
     Finally, note is made of a nasogastric tube, terminating in the stomach.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of acute fracture or pneumothorax. However, the lateral right
     rib cage is not completely imaged on this exam and additional image to include
     this region would be helpful if there is clinical suspicion for injury in this
     area.
     2. Minimal linear left lower lobe opacity which may relate to focal
     atelectasis or scarring.

Pt detoxed while in the hospital for a broken ankle, but was unable to maintain any period of sobriety.

Pts [**Last Name (un) **] and sister expressed significant anger regarding pts alcohol dependence, while mother expressed sadness and frustration over recent events.  SW offered ongoing support and psychoed around alcohol dependence and recommended AlAnon for support.  SW will follow.  Pls pg prn.

                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     
     INDICATION:  s/p fall, f/u frontal and temporal lobe contusions.
     
     Non-contrast head ct is performed and compared to yesterday's study.
     
     CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Again seen, are intraparenchyma hematomas within both
     anterior frontal lobes and inferior temporal lobes, within both the anterior
     and middle cranial fossas.  Scattered areas  of subarachnoid hemorrhage are
     less discrete today.  There remains preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 20**]/white matter
     differentiation.  There is minimal leftward shift of the subfalcine
     herniation. There is mild compression of the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 116**] of the right
     ventricle, unchanged and effacement of the sulci of the right frontal lobe,
     also unchanged.  There is no  other evidence of other herniation.  Examination
     of osseous structures again shows a sagittally-oriented fracture of the
     frontal bone, extending from the junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures.
     There is a new fluid level within the right maxillary sinus which raises the
     possibility of occult facial fracture.
     
     IMPRESSION: No  significant interval change in bilateral frontal and temporal
     lobe parenchymal hemorrhages with slight decrease in conspicuity of
     subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is new air fluid level of the right maxillary
     sinus as described above.

Neuro: Pt is confused and agitated on/off. c-collar in place. Getting ativan 2mg as well as haldol 2.5mg IV Q4hrs. Pt able to state his name but is not oriented to place and time most of the time. MAE, follows commands inconsistently. PEARL 4mm bilat. Family came in to visit and state that he has had severe alcohol withdrawal/DT's in past and usually gets worse 3-4 days after his last drink. (Pt admitted [**10-9**]) I had to apply posey waist belt to keep him safe after finding him attempting to get OOB even with wrist restaints in place. While he was up to chair he was very unsafe. He was found OOB across the room once before the waist posey was applied and then after this he was found biting his IV tubing which he had bit through and through. I put him back to bed at that time. Posey and wrist restraints are in place. Will monitor closely for the need for a sitter to maintain safety but he seems safe at this point with close observation.

CV:  BP 130-160. He will get labetolol drip restarted for BP>150. He is on PO lopressor BID. HR 80's-90's. NSR.

Resp: Pt on RA with good sat. Productive cough for thick green sputum. RR 16-24.

GI: Taking small amts PO's with assistance. Takes pills when awake, sitting bolt upright in bed. Abdomen soft, round +BS.

GU: Urine is bloody at times due to agitation, pulling at foley. Otherwise urine is clear yellow. Order was written for foley to be taken out but after discussing this with team they said we could wait until he is more with it to use urinal. He currently could not coordinate himself enough to do this.

ID: Pt with low grade temp 100-100.5 PO. ON no antibiotics.

Heme: Neurosurg team wanted platelet count to be greater than 100 so pt given a bag of platelets today with post plt ct 108. Team aware.

Plan: Follow neuro status Q2hrs- chack CIWA and use ativan PRN as well as haldol. Keep SBP<150. Titrate labetolol drip as needed to do this.
Keep pt safe by close observation and possible 1:1 sitter needed.
