.
C-Spine MRI:
FINDINGS: At C5-6 level, there is widening of the anterior disc 
space identified with increased signal in this region on 
inversion recovery images. In addition, there is buckling of the 
ligamentum flavum visualized posteriorly with subtle increased 
signal in the interspinous region. Findings are indicative of 
ligamentous disruption both in the anterior and posterior 
portion of the spine. In addition, there is a large prevertebral 
hematoma identified extending from C2 to the upper thoracic 
region. There is no evidence of intraspinal hematoma seen. There 
is increased signal identified within the spinal cord at C4-5 
level which could be related to cord edema or contusion.
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen at other levels in the 
cervical region extending at C3-4, C4-5, C6-7 and C7-T1 level 
with mild anterolisthesis of C7 or T1.
Of concern is absence of flow void within both vertebral 
arteries in the cervical region. This is best visualized on 
axial T2-weighted axial images which show high signal is seen 
within both vertebral arteries. These findings are indicative of 
extremely slow flow or occlusion of both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable extension injury with disruption of the anterior 
longitudinal and the intraspinous and nuchal ligaments in the 
region of C5-6 level.
2. Large prevertebral hematoma in the cervical region.
3. Abnormal signal within both vertebral arteries in the neck 
suspicious for slow flow or occlusion. MRA or CTA would help for 
further assessment.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical region.
5. Focus of increased signal within the spinal cord at C4-5 
level suspicious for cord edema/contusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
.
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7206**] was admitted to the Trauma service after being 
evaluated in the EW and found to have an unstable C5-6 fracture 
dislocation.  It was his lone injury and he was admitted and 
given a floor bed.  Transfered to floor & had episode of 
deliriumsundowning, continually trying to get out of bed. 
Scheduled for surgical repair of C-spine [**5-17**] but INR was 2.3 
and procedure deferred until [**5-18**]. In holding area was noted to 
be gurgling, still confused. Decision made to electively 
intubate, done in OR with fiberoptic scope/surgical airway 
back-up. Intermittently bradycardic and an EP consult was 
sought.  Tachy/brady syndrome was observed and a pacemaker was 
placed by EP [**5-18**].  At this time he was stable for an anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion C5-6.  Post-opertively he was 
transfered back to the T/SICU for further care.  While there, he 
had significant episodes of tachycardia & bradycardia and 
required placement of a pacemaker because of this.
.
He was eventually transferred to the wards, where he had 
difficulty swallowing and continued delirium.  A Geriatrics 
consult was sought for a possible CVA leading to his difficulty 
swallowing.  A CT of the head was obtained which showed no 
evidence of acute intracranial process.  He was [**Hospital 7207**] 
transfered to the Geriatrics service for further managment.
.
Shortly after transfer to the medicine wards, pt he became 
dyspneic in the settig copious oral secretions. He was found to 
have pneumonia (likely aspiration) and was transferred to the 
MICU for treatment of PNA and copious secretions.  He was 
initially treated with levo/flagyl for probable aspiration PNA; 
this was then broadened to vanc/Zosyn.  Pt did not require 
intubation/pressors in MICU.  Rather, he was weaned off oxygen 
and was treated for HTN.  
While in the MICU, the MICU team met with the family to discuss 
the pt's overall prognosis and review the pt's goals of care.  
They explained that the pt's  aspiration/dysphagia was likely a 
complication from the sugery, and that the pt would not likely 
regain his swallowing function.  Given the degree of the pt's 
injury, including the possibility that he may not be able to 
walk again and his inability to take PO (at least for the 
foreseeable future), the pt decided that pursuing agressive care 
would not fit with his wishes or goals.  His son corroborated 
these feelings.  Another meeting was had with the family and the 
medicine [**Hospital1 **] team on [**2544-6-1**] (following transfer out of the 
MICU).  During this meeting, the son reiterated his and his 
father's wish to move to hospice care.  He explained that they 
understand that the pt could at some point regain swallowing 
function.  Yet, waiting for that possibility would be not be in 
line with his wishes and goals.  As the pt stated on [**2544-5-31**], he 
feels ""the end is near...I have lived a good life.""  He then 
expressed his wish to be out of the hospital setting and to 
enjoy what time he has left.  
.
He was treated with care and comfort measures only prior to 
discharge. At time of discharge, pt had very dry mucous 
membranes for which he was receiving supportive care.  He denied 
having any pain.
