     STUDY:  MR of the abdomen dated [**2959-5-30**].
     
     INDICATION:  61-year-old female with left renal mass.  Possible renal
     carcinoma with metastasis.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5 T
     magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging, obtained prior to, during and after the
     intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-DTPA.
     
     Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for the
     dynamic series.
     
     There are no prior studies available.
     
     FINDINGS:  There is a large, complex mass emenating from and replacing the mid
     portion of the left kidney, measuring 9.2 x 11.9 x 8.6 cm in the AP, CC, and
     transverse dimension, respectively. This mass contains a central area of
     necrosis and thick rim of enhancing viable tumor in the periphery. Whithin
     this rim, several foci of decreased signal intensity on opposed-phased
     images is consistent with small amounts of fat. These findings are consistent
     renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. The tumor invades the perirenal fat and
     Gerota's fascia, lateraly. The superior portion of the mass abuts the spleen.
     While there is no intervening fat plane, there is no obvious splenic invasion.
     The anterior and inferior aspect of the mass abuts left colon. No intervening
     fat plane is identified, although there is no definite colonic invasion.  An
     intervening fat plane is identified between the mass and the tail of the
     pancreas.  There is tumor thrombus within the left renal vein that extends
     across the midline and terminates at the junction of the IVC.
     
     There is a mass within the right adrenal gland, measuring 2.2 x 3.1 x 2.8 cm
     in the AP, transverse and CC dimensions, respectively, which is heterogenous
     in signal intensity with foci of high T2 signal relative to adjacent kidney.
     This finding is most consistent with metastatic disease.  The left adrenal
     appears normal.  The right kidney contains two subcentimeter simple cysts, but
     is otherwise normal.
     
     The visualized portion of the liver, spleen and pancreas are normal.  There is
     a prominent left paraaortic lymph node, measuring 9 mm in short axis (sequence
     #300, image #39). There is no ascites.
     
     Within the L5 vertebral body, there is a region of high T2 signal compared to
                                                                 (Over)

     adjacent spine that enhances and which does not drop out on out- of-phase
     images. While this may represent an atypical appearance of hemangioma,
     metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  Correlation with bone scan or CT may
     be obtained. No evidence of metastatic disease within the remaining visualized
     osseous structures.
     
     Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations provided multiple perspectives for the

History of Present Illness:
61-yo-woman w/ renal cell CA dx [**2959-5-23**] after developing painless 
hematuria, presented to [**Hospital1 83**] ED yesterday w/ increasing dyspnea 
on exertion. CTA of the chest, which had been done in 
preparation for left nephrectomy (scheduled for [**2959-6-18**]) 
revealed PE in the RUL, w/ multiple wedge shaped consolidations 
concerning for pulm infarcts. She was admitted to the FICU for 
initial management. Has been hemodynamically stable since 
admission.  
 
Of note, admission workup revealed guaiac positive stool and 
continued hematuria, w/ occasional clots passed in the urine. 
The decision was made to transfuse 1 unit PRBCs to bolster the 
pt's baseline HCT, then treat w/ heparin for PE and monitor HCT 
closely. HCT has increased appropriately from 24-->27 after 
transfusion and has been stable since then. She is now 
transferred to the Medicine service for further care.

.
MRI abdomen ([**2959-5-30**]):  
1. Large, complex left renal mass with imaging features most 
consistent with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Tumor invasion 
of perirenal fat and Gerota's fascia and tumor thrombus in left 
renal vein extending to junction of IVC.  
2. Right adrenal metastasis.  
3. Atypical hemangioma vs. metastatic disease of L5 for which 
correlation with bone scan or CT may be obtained.  
.  
Chest CTA ([**2959-6-13**]):  
1. Pulmonary embolism in the interlobar arteries of the 
posterior  
basal segment as well as of the branch feeding the right upper 
lobe.  
2. Multiple numerous nodules scattered throughout both lungs, 
which in this patient is worrisome with surrounding ground-glass 
opacity, which in this patient is worrisome for metastatic 
disease.  
3. Several wedge shaped opacities scattered throughout both 
lungs, which could be secondary to emboli.  
.  
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:  1. Multiple pulmonary emboli are again seen within 
the arterial branches to the right upper and right lower lung 
lobes as well as the left lower lung lobes. 
2. New pulmonary embolus in the arterial branch supplying the 
lateral segment of the right middle lobe probably an extension 
from the large clot burden in the right main pulmonary artery. 
3. New airspace opacification within the left lower lung lobe, 
which likely represents infiltrate from infection versus 
infarction. 
4. Multiple, unchanged nodular opacities scattered throughout 
the lungs, which are consistent with metastatic disease. 
5. Right adrenal gland mass, not completely characterized as it 
was seen only on the non-contrast portion of this examination. 
.
[**6-26**]:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDIES:  Grayscale and Doppler 
sonograms of the 
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal 
veins were 
performed.  There is normal flow, compressibility and 
augmentation of these vessels.  No intraluminal thrombus is 
identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT. 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pulmonary embolism:
Patient had above CTA results on admission and was started on a 
heparin drip for anticiagulation. The embolus may represent 
tumor fragments, which is likely given visible tumor thrombus in 
the L renal vein. However, a thrombotic embolus can not be ruled 
out. There is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise at present.  
  
.  
2) Renal Cell Carcinoma- plan for L nephrectomy on Monday. 
Patient had left upper quadrant pain on admission that was 
thought secondary to intra-tumor hemorrhage vs renal capsular 
stretching. Abdominal CT did not reveal any retroperitoneal 
hemorrhage. The patient was given dilaudid for pain control.
.  .  
3) Hyponatremia: 
Most likely seconary to SIADH in the setting of pulmonary 
nodules. Diagnosis was supported by as supported by decreased 
serum sodium after normal saline administered in the ED (likely 
hypoosmotic compared w/ urine osm). High urine osmolality and 
high urine sodium. The pt appears euvolemic on exam. She 
responded appropriately to fluid restriction of 1 liter per day. 
 
.  
4) Guaiac positive stool: 
Source was unclear at present, though metastatic disease is a 
likely possibility given lack of localizing GI symptoms. Patient 
was anticoagulated on heparin gtt. Hematocrit was followed 
closely. GI work up will be needed pending neprectomy.
.  
5) Anemia: 
Iron deficiency in this pt. HCT stable during her admission. 
Goal hematocrit of 25 was maintained via transfusion of 1unit 
PRBC's on admission.
.  
6) Diabetes type 2: 
metformin and glyburide were discontinued on admission in 
preoperative period. Pt was maintained on weight based insulin: 
NPH twice daily, humalog before meals, and a humalong sliding 
scale. She should resume her oral antiglycemics as an 
outpatient.

Ms [**Known patient lastname 5884**] was transfered to the care of the Urology service 
after her surgical procedure. She was prepared and consented for 
surgery as per standard. Preoperatively, the patient was found 
to be a bit dyspneic.  A chest CT which was
obtained at our institution had demonstrated a pulmonary 
embolus. As a result, she was admitted to the hospital 5 days 
ago and was started on IV heparin. At this point she presents 
for left radical nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus. 
There were no significant intra-operative complications. 
On the floor, Ms [**Known patient lastname 5884**] was carefully monitored for cardiac 
complications and endocrine dysfunction. The endocrine team saw 
her and requested for an 8am cortisol test two days in a row; 
her cortisol levels were normal and aldosterone levels are still 
pending. A cortisol stimulation test was advised, but failed on 
two attempts, however it was felt that her 8am cortisol level 
was sufficient. The endocrine team felt the metastases to the 
remaining adrenal had not drastically affected her 
adrenal/endocrine function at this time.
Ms [**Known patient lastname 5884**] was also followed by the cardiac team. Over the 
course of 9 days, she continued to do well and consistently 
progress. She was slowly weaned from oxygen  by postoperative 
day six, and physical therapy regularly started to see her. 
Initially, her oxygen saturation would drop (lowwest of 78%) 
during exertion; however, this improved over the course of 3 
days until she was able to walk on her own, without oxygen 
supplmentation and assistance.
On postoperative days five and six, a new pulmonary embolus was 
discovered; the pulmonary service was asked to consult in 
regards to the best treatment options available. Their advice 
was LENI's to determine whether there was a lower extremity 
source for the recurrent emboli and if so, to consider placement 
of a filter. They also reccomended for an echo, which did not 
show any evidence of right heart strain. The LENI's obtained did 
not show a deep vein thrombus in either limb, and hence, the 
idea of placing a filter was discarded. Instead, per pulmonary 
consult, anticoaguation with coumadin was decided on with a 
target INR between [**12-22**]. 
Ms [**Known patient lastname 5884**] was started on coumadin, with regular INR 
monitoring. Upon discharge, the coumadin dose the prior night 
was held and her INR was 4.2. She was told to hold coumadin the 
night of her discharge, and VNA was arranged in order to monitor 
the INR levels in the next week. These results will be sent to 
her PCP who will then adjust her coumadin dose as necessary. 
Currently, she was sent home with 10 days of coumadin, 
alternating between 2.5mg and 5.0mg.
