Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1736**] 
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for stenting of right mainstem bronchus
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy with bronchial stent removal.
 
History of Present Illness:
80 yo man w/ h/o Stage 3B lung cancer (s/p chemo, XRT, and stent 
placement [**7-14**]), COPD on home O2, CAD (multivessel disease and 
80% LM stenosis), A fib, and LLE DVT who presents from OSH with 
obstructed right sided bronchus with post-obstructive pneumonia 
for possible stenting.  On [**8-30**] the patient underwent 
bronchoscopy which showed tumor occluding the stent which was 
partially removed.  After this procedure, the patient went into 
respiratory distress in the PACU and required intubation.  He 
was also noted to have ST elevations on EKG in leads V2 and V3.  
STAT echo revealed EF of 25%, decreased from 60% in [**3112-7-10**].  
The patient was admitted to the MICU at the OSH for further 
management. 
.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient was hypotensive to the 70's 
systolic which responded to IV fluid bolus.  Cardiology was 
consulted regarding his ST elevations and recommended medical 
management with addition of plavix for his left main disease.  
Eventually, the patient was also started on low dose metoprolol 
and captopril after his blood pressure stabilized.  The 
following morning, his ST elevations had normalized.   
Cardiology felt that his previous changes were due to myocardial 
stunning.  During his OSH MICU course, he was also found to have 
focal neuro deficits (left ptosis, left facial droop) so a head 
CT was done.  This study revealed an old right parietal infarct 
with moderate chronic small vessel infarcts without evidence of 
enhancing lesions. 
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 83**] for possible stenting of 
his right sided bronchial occlusion.  He was hemodynamically 
stable on arrival, and denied CP, SOB, abdominal pain, headache, 
or dizziness.

CXR was done showing complete whiteout of the right lung [**3-13**] to 
post-obstructive pneumonia.  He was started on Vanco and Zosyn 
for treatment of pneumonia.  Chest CT the following day revealed 
bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), complete RUL/RML/RLL collapse 
with apparent obstruction of the bronchial stent within the 
right main stem bronchus.  
 
Past Medical History:
- Stage 3B Lung Cancer: dx [**3111-12-11**]; s/p 8 courses of 
chemo; s/p XRT; s/p stent in right bronchus [**7-14**]; s/p 5 
therapeutic bronchoscopies (for reocclusion of stent)
- COPD on home O2
- CAD: s/p cath [**3112-1-25**] showing multivessel disease, LM 80%
- A FIB: started on digoxin 3 weeks prior to admission
- s/p LLE DVT: 2000 and [**3112-2-10**] (s/p hernia repair); 
treated with coumadin and plavix in the past
- s/p CVA x 2 
- s/p hernia repair
- s/p left eye surgery for ptosis (3.5 yrs ago)
- s/p cataract surgery
 
Social History:
Lives at home with his wife.  Good social support.  60 pack year 
smoking history.  
 
Family History:
CAD
CVA - sister and father
[**Name (NI) 5730**] cancer - brother (smoker)

.
PORTABLE CXR @ OSH ([**9-3**]): improvement in vascular congestion 
and slight alveolar fluid from yesterday.  Persistent 
opacification of the right hemithorax.
.
CT CHEST @ OSH ([**8-31**]): 
1) Large right sided pleural effusion and moderate size left 
sided pleural effusion. 
2) Complete collapse of the RUL, RLL, and RML with apparent 
obstruction of bronchial stent within the right main stem 
bronchus and soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess 
likely representing patient's known lung cancer.
3) Emphysematous changes throughout the LUL w/ septal thickening 
which may be due to scarring, atelectasis although no 
lymphangitic spread of disease cannot be entirely excluded. 
4) Areas of compressive atelectasis within the LLL. Incidental 
note is made of infrarenal AAA (2.9 x 2.4 cm).

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt bronched [**9-4**], showing right main bronchus stent frayed at 
distal end, blocking RUL and with thick secretions distally. 
Left bronchus was patent. Overnight [**9-4**], patient was was 
hypotensive; did not respond to IVF bolus and PRBCs.  Low dose 
Dopamine started with improvement of BP.  ~20 min after dopamine 
started, patient went into RVR.  Dopamine stopped.  Amiodarone 
started, patient still tachycardic and hypotensive.  At this 
point, patient underwent synchronized cardioversion (200 and 
then 300 joules), did not convert to NSR, but rate became more 
controlled in low 100's.  Levophed started for BP control, 
subsequently weaned off [**9-5**], converted to NS on amiodarone 
drip.

Pt never weaned off mechanical ventilation through his hospital 
course.  Spontaneous breathing trials were poorly tolerated.  In 
addition, his cardiovascular function was tenuous.  He had acute 
drop in blood pressure with cardiac enzyme leak on [**9-12**] and 
throughout his course remained intermittently hypotensive and 
also bradycardic at times.  Per family request pressor were not 
given.  It became clear given the patients invasive lung cancer 
and severe coronary artery disease that the prognosis was 
extremely poor.   On [**3112-9-13**] a family meeting was held.  The 
outcome of this was that pt would remain intubated but would 
also still be DNR and would be given no escalation in care 
including pressors or antiarrhythmics.  The family asked whether 
it would be possible to send pt home on ventilator so that he 
may spend his last days at home.  Such arrangements were made 
but required that the patient undergo tracheostomy.  
Unfortunately the patient was never sufficiently hemodynamically 
stable that this procedure could safely be performed.

On [**3112-9-20**] another family meeting was held.  It was explained 
that tracheostomy was not possible to perform safely and that 
the patient would probably spend the remainder of his days in 
the hospital.  The daughters decided that care should move 
toward comfort measures only.  Efforts were made to pursue care 
such that the patient would remain alive over the weekend so 
that he may have visitors.  Of note the patient was noted to 
disseminated multi-drug resistant Klebsiella infection by blood 
culture, sputum culture, and urine culture.  No antibiotics wore 
started.  Comfort measure only care was instituted in full on 
[**9-23**] with the goal of making the patient comfortable.  The 
patient went into respiratory failure on  the evening of 8/16 
and expired that night.  Attending was duly notified.  The 
family was notified.  Autopsy was declined.

In summary Mr [**Known patient lastname 5731**], is an 80 year-old gentleman with a 
history of stage 3b terminal lung cancer, atrial fibrillation 
and severe coronary artery disease who presented with hypoxic 
respiratory failure requring intubation that was secondary to 
total R bronchial obstruction and post-obstructive pneumonia.  
It became clear that efforts to treat his disease proved futile 
in the setting of his terminal disease, and eventually the 
patient placed in comfort measure only care and passed away.

Events: Pt hypotensive throughout evening...ABP 78-90/40-60's with MAP 50-60's. 500cc NS bolus given with an increase in CVP, but little effect to BP. MICU team decided to start dopamine for hypotension...? cardiogenic shock and the need to increase preload. Dopamine started, but only infusing for 1/2half before patient became tachycardic upto 150's. BP stable at first, and when BP started to be effected levophed started and patient bolused with amiodarone and gtt started. Pt still symptomatic with BP in 60's and cardioverted once at 200, then 300. Bp currently in controlled afib 90's. Digoxin dose increased. Heparin gtt stopped yesterday afternoon for procedures (bronch and thoracentesis). PTT 130 prior to heparin gtt being stopped and infusing at 1100units/hr. Restarted last evening around 2130 at 800units. Am coags pending. 

CV: HR 80-90's, controlled afib with no ectopy prior to initiation of dopamine gtt. HR 1/2hr after dopamine 105-150, requiring amio bolus and cardioversion. Dopamine d/c and pt currently on levophed at 0.08mcg/kg. Pt hypotensive throughout night as described above, but since levo 110-120/60's with MAP 68-80. Pt received total of 750cc NS fluid bolus and 1unit PRBC for Hct 26.9 (goal >30 d/t presence of cardiac disease).

NPN 7a-7p

Events-  Pt. converted to NSR this am, levophed was weaned off, now back in A-fib.  Pt. received 250cc FB for CVP of 8 and decreasing u/o X 1.  U/o maintained at 30cc/hr, now dropping off again.  Fio2 again decreased back down to 40% with stable ABG.  Cardiology consulted recommending Amiodorone bolusing (150mg) if Afib persists w/ RVR. Family met with Attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91**] and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]. To OR tom'row for rigid bronch.  Hospice consult placed to pallative care team ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 92**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 93**] and case mgmt.)as a heads up for when pt. is awake and appropriate. 

Review of Systems-

Neuro-  Pt. remains on low dose fentanyl and versed and is interactive to voice, follows commands.  Family expressing interest in having him more awake after rigid bronch to talk plan of care with him.  Would decrease sedation if/ if does not go to OR tom'row to aide in family's need for his participation in decision making if appropriate.

Resp-  Increased sx'ing requirements, pt. with strong highly productive cough.  Stable sats, tolerating decrease in fio2, stable ABG.  LS- coarse throughout.  To OR tom'row for rigid bronch and removal of stent- explained that pt. is high risk for this procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  

CV-  HR 80's-100's currently Afib, previously converted to NSR this am with 12 lead EKG taken at the time.  Pt. received on 0.08mcg/kg/min of levophed which was weaned to off this am.  Pt. remains on heparin gtt with therapeutic PTT and amiodorone gtt which was decreased to 0.05mg/min at 10a, to infuse through 4a and start PO.  However, now that pt. back in Afib, team may elect to keep pt. on IV gtt for longer than 24 hours.  CVP 8-12.  Bolused X 1 250cc/hr for low CVP and u/o.  Team feels that pt. has significant diastolic dysfunction with normal EF so fluid balance is a difficult to manage.  SVO2 was attempted however distal port of CVC not functioning, sample sent from medial port and came back as 39- thought to be venous.  So fick was not achieved.  Skin with red area on coccyx- pt. kept off back, heels elevated off bed.  

GI-  TF started at 20cc/hr and increased to 40cc towards goal of 50cc/hr of Promote with fiber.  ABD Soft.  No stool.

GU- U/o marginal at 20-30cc/hr, team aware that it has dropped off the past few hours, but CVP >10 so we have not bolused w/ IVF.  

ID-  Conts on vanco and ceftaz, afebrile.  

Social-  2 dtrs in today, met with team as mentioned, and SW.  Talkign of hospice level care after pt. is d/c'd from hospital.  Pallative team notified of pt. and family's request.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Possible post-obstructive pneumonia.  Evaluate pulmonary infiltrate.
     
     chest, single ap vw
     
     An ET tube is present, tip at the upper level of the clavicles, somewhat high.
     An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  Again seen
     is a right bronchial stent.
     
     There is considerable opacification of the right lung, with only a small
     residual portion of aerated lung centrally, extending from upper to lower
     zones. On the left, there is diffuse vascular blurring and more confluent
     opacity at left base, including left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
     and probable small-to-moderate left effusion.
     
     Direct comparison to [**3112-9-6**] chest x-ray is somewhat difficult given marked
     differences in patient positioning and motion and respiratory motion on the
     current study. However, overall, there is negligible interval change in the
     cardiopulmonary findings. There may be some increased aeration on the right.
     Of note, the tip of the ET tube appears to be higher on today's exam, though
     this in part relates to marked differences in positioning.

     COMMENTS:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed, and
     compared with the previous study of yesterday.
     
     There is marked increase in right pleural effusion with near complete collapse
     of the right lung.  The patient is known to have the lung cancer with stent in
     the bronchus intermedius.
     
     There is also increased pulmonary edema in the left lung.  There is small left
     pleural effusion.
     
     The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right jugular IV catheter remain
     in place.  No pneumothorax is seen.

                  80 year old man with h/o lung cancer c/b occluded bronchus s/p     
      intubation, difficult to oxygenate on vent.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for pna, ptx, effusion, edema

     PORTABLE CHEST, [**3112-9-17**].
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3112-9-15**].
     
     INDICATION:  Difficulty oxygenating.  History of lung cancer.
     
     The examination is somewhat limited due to exclusion of the extreme lateral
     aspect of the right lung, but the technologist reports that the patient was
     difficult to position for the radiograph and that the submitted image was the
     best possible under the circumstances.
     
     An endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, and right bronchial stent
     remain in place.  There remains volume loss in the right hemithorax.  There is
     collapse of the majority of the right lung with only a small amount of aerated
     lung centrally.  A large right pleural effusion persists.  There is worsening
     confluent alveolar opacification within the left lung, and there has been
     interval increase in a left pleural effusion, now moderate in size.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Worsening diffuse alveolar opacities in the left lung, which may be due to
     either pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia.
     
     2.  Persistent near complete collapse of right lung, likely postobstructive.
     
     3.  Stable large right and increasing moderate left pleural effusions.

     INDICATION:  80-year-old man with history of lung cancer.  Evaluate for
     infiltrate and obstruction.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP semi erect chest radiograph from [**3112-9-19**] is compared
     with AP supine chest radiograph from [**3112-9-17**].
     
     Compared to prior radiograph as well as radiographs from the prior several
     days, there is a decrease in the moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with
     associated reexpansion of the right lung.  Of note, now the left lung has
     developed an area of increased consolidation, consistent with worsening
     pneumonia.
     
     The endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular catheter tip are in
     standard positions.  The nasogastric tube is in the stomach, however, the tip
     cannot be visualized.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Decreased moderate-size right pleural effusion with associated reexpansion
     of the right lung.
     2.  Worsening consolidation in the left lung consistent with pneumonia.
