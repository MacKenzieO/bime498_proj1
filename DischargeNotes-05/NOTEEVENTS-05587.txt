GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed 
above. I certify  
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE 
related  
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia 
throughout the  
procedure. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Results 
were  
personally reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.  
   
Conclusions:  
PRE-CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe 
spontaneous  
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No 
mass/thrombus is seen  
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Moderate to severe 
spontaneous  
echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left 
atrial  
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right 
atrium is  
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of 
the right  
atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or  
color Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is 
mild symmetric  
left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal.  
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. 
There is mild  
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple 
atheroma in  
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the 
descending  
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. Trace  
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened.  
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are  
mildly thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. 
There is a  
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  
  
POST-CPB Normal right ventricular systolic function. Left 
ventricle initially  
with some mild septal hypokinesis which improved after 15 
minutes. Overall EF  
about 50-55%. No other changes from pre-CPB.

READING PHYSICIAN: 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1207**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 83**] on [**3469-9-13**] for further 
management of her chest pain. She underwent a cardiac 
catheterization which revealed 95% mid LAD lesion, 80% LCX 
stenosis,and a 99% diffuse RCA lesion.  An echo showed an EF of 
60-70%. Given the nature and severity of her disease, the 
cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical 
revascularization. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative 
manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed 
minimal internal carotid artery disease bilaterally. 
Ciprofloxacin was started for a urinary tract infection. Heparin 
was continued for anticoagulation. On [**3469-9-17**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1207**] was 
taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary artery 
bypass grafting to four vessels and a left atrial appendage 
ligation. Postoperatively she was transferred to the cardiac 
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She developed some 
atrial fibrillation overnight that was self limited. On 
postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1207**] [**Last Name (Titles) 503**] neurologically intact 
and was extubated. She was transfused for postoperative anemia. 
Coumadin was resumed for her atrial fibrillation. On 
postoperative day three, she was transferred to the step down 
unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her 
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted 
for assistance with her postoperativ strength and mobility. The 
geriatrics service was consulted for assistance with her memory 
loss. Multiple medications as well as a social work evaluation 
were recommended and implemented. It is recommended that she 
follow up with the neurobehaviorist after discharge (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6752**]).

Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1207**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged 
to rehab on [**3469-9-28**] in stable condition. She will follow-up 
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care 
physician as an outpatient.

     COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**3462-8-14**].
     
     PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY:  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours
     are normal.  There are dense intramural aortic calcifications.  Prominence of
     the right hilum may does not correlate with a corresponding abnormality on
     the lateral film and is likely related to overlapping vessels. The pulmonary
     vasculature is normal. There is no pneumothorax. Both lungs are clear without
     consolidations or effusions. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

     HISTORY:  82-year-old woman with severe coronary artery disease.  Preoperative
     evaluation before CABG.
     
     RADIOLOGIST:  The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1350**] [**Name (STitle) 128**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries was performed with
     B-mode, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound.
     
     FINDINGS:  A mild amount of plaque was seen bilaterally in the internal
     carotid arteries.
     
     On the right side, peak systolic velocities were 62 cm/sec for the internal
     carotid artery, 48 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 71 cm/sec for the
     external carotid artery.  The right ICA/CCA ratio was 1.2.
     
     On the left side, peak systolic velocities were 71 cm/sec for the ICA, 46
     cm/sec for the CCA and 68 cm/sec for the ECA.  The left ICA/CCA ratio was 1.5.
     
     
     Both vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow with a peak systolic velocity
     of 62 cm/sec on the right and 45 cm/sec on the left.
     
     COMPARISON:  None available.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Less than 40% stenosis in the bilateral internal carotid
     arteries, in their extracranial portion.

     COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**3469-9-18**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  AP upright single view of the chest.
     
     FINDINGS:  The right IJ central line has been removed.  The patient is status
     post median sternotomy.  The aorta is calcified.  The cardiac contour remains
     enlarged but is unchanged.  There is a persistent perihilar haziness which is
     consistent with CHF and mild fluid overload.  There is a new left retrocardiac
     opacity that most likely represent atelectasis.  However, aspiration pneumonia
     or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1)  Mild pulmonary edema.
     2)  New left retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis, but pneumonia
     or aspiration cannot be excluded.
