Date of Birth:   [**3384-7-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC S.

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  Pending awaiting rehabilitation bed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increased chest pain and shortness of
breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a known history of coronary artery disease and
recent onset of atrial fibrillation.  The patient complained
of increased symptoms of dyspnea and angina.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel disease.
He is now admitted for coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
2.  Recent onset atrial fibrillation in the past eight weeks.
3.  Tuberculosis.  The patient was hospitalized for two
months in the 1980s.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Prostate carcinoma status post XRT and brachytherapy.
8.  CVA times three in [**3433**], [**3443**], and 1996.
9.  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right carotid endarterectomy in [**3444**].
2.  Stomach repair status post multiple stab wounds in the
1960s.
3.  Benign tumor left axillary area, probably 1960s.
4.  Back surgery in [**3424**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Plavix discontinued [**3-28**].
2.  Detrol 2 mg b.i.d.
3.  Atenolol 75 mg in the AM; 50 mg q.PM.
4.  Glyburide 3 mg b.i.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg h.s.
6.  Amitriptyline 10 mg q.d.
7.  Zestril 30 mg q.a.m. and 10 mg q.p.m.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to ASPIRIN, WHICH CAUSES
INCREASED FACIAL SWELLING AND INCREASED SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent coronary artery
bypass graft times on [**3453-4-5**].  The patient was taken to the
CSRU intubated and on Milrinone and nitroglycerin drips.  The
patient was extubated on postoperative day #1.  He was
started on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was slightly agitated
and required Haldol.  The blood pressure was labile and he
needed antihypertensive medication.  The patient continued to
be in atrial fibrillation.  He made slow progress over the
next couple of days.  He had some episodes of wheezing, which
improved with treatment with nebulizers.  The patient
progressively improved in his mental status and he was more
oriented in the next couple of days.

On [**3453-4-10**], while on the bedside commode, the patient had a
brief period of unresponsiveness for about 30 seconds.  The
heart rate and blood pressure were stable at this point.  The
patient was transferred to the regular floor in stable
condition on postoperative day #6.  While on the floor, the
mental status again improved significantly.  He was left
confused and more oriented.  He was started on heparin drip
for atrial fibrillation and on Coumadin.  The pacing wires
were discontinued on postoperative day #7.  He stayed in
house until he became therapeutic on his Coumadin.  He was
ready for discharge to rehabilitation on postoperative day
#9.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 75 mg b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg q.d. times one week.
3.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 123**] 20 mEq q.d. times one week.

8.  Lisinopril 30 mg q.a.m., 10 mg q.p.m.
9.  Coumadin 3 mg q.d. with goal INR 1.8 to 2.5.  The primary
care physician is to follow the INR after discharge from
rehabilitation.
10.  Glyburide 3 mg b.i.d.
11.  Lipitor 10 mg h.s.
12.  Tylenol with codeine one to two tablets q.4h. to

     The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass
     surgery. There has been interval removal of a left sided chest tube, ET tube,
     NG tube and swan ganz catheter.  A left internal jugular vascular sheath
     remains in place.
     
     Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in
     technique.  There has been interval increase in size of a small left pleural
     effusion.  Hazy increased opacity in the right hemithorax may represent a
     component of pleural fluid as well.  Atelectatic changes are seen in both lung
     bases.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. No evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal, but slight
     increase in size of left pleural effusion is noted. Bibasilar atelectasis is
     also noted.

     PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to exams of [**3453-4-9**] and [**3453-3-30**].  Status
     post median sternotomy.  A left-sided central venous catheter is in place with
     the tip overlying the junction of the distal left brachiocephalic vein and
     superior vena cava.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  There is persistent
     cardiomegaly.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions with improved
     aeration of both lung bases compared to the most previous exam.  When compared
     to the exam of [**3453-3-30**], the opacities at the right lung base are likely
     chronic.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Tip of left-sided central venous catheter overlies confluence of
     distal left brachiocephalic vein/SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Improved
     aeration of lung bases compared to exam of [**3453-4-9**].

     PA and lateral chest [**3453-4-23**] at 9 PM.
     
     Comparison is made to prior study dated [**3453-4-11**]. The patient has taken a poor
     inspiration on the AP film. Therefore, there are increased basilar opacities.
     There is no evidence of vascular redistribution to the apices suggesting that
     no congestive failure is present. Sternal wound closure cannot be assessed on
     this study.

     COMPARISON STUDY: [**3453-2-21**].
     
     CHEST SINGLE VIEW: The heart is enlarged but stable in appearance. There has
     been interval resolution of the pulmonary edema. There is some persistent
     small bilateral pleural effusions present. There has been interval insertion
     of a right sided PICC. It turns inferiorly from the axillary vein into a
     tributary likely a subscapular vein. This PICC demonstrates fracture of and
     separation of the distal fracture fragment by approximately 1 cm. The distal
     fracture fragment is approximately 4 cm in length. No fracture fragment is
     identified within the pulmonary parenchyma. Patient is s/p median sternotomy.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Interval insertion of a right sided PICC which turns inferiorly from the
     axillary vein and terminates within a probable subscapular vein. There is a
     fracture of the PICC leaving the distal fracture fragment approximately 1 cm
     from the PICC. The distal fracture fragment is approximately 4 cm in length.
     
     2) Stable cardiomegaly with resolved pulmonary edema and small bilateral
     pleural effusions.
     
     These findings were communicated to the IV access service.

     Radiology Fellow Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8810**] [**Name (STitle) 7759**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 179**]
     was present for the entirety of the procedure.  The patient was placed in
     supine position with the right upper extremity sterilely prepped and draped.
     Fluoroscopy demonstrated no apparent fragment at the PICC line, which was
     located in a vein near the tip of the scapula.  Venogram did not demonstrate
     evidence of fragmented PICC line.  The PICC was removed, and measured and
     found to be 55 cm.  As the insertion note recorded the PICC length as 55 cm,
     no fragment was lost.  Sterile dressing was applied on the site.
     
     MEDICATIONS:  No medications were given.
     
     COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.
     
     FINDINGS:  No free fragment of PICC was seen, and venogram demonstrated the
     current PICC line to have its tip in the veins near the scapula.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1) Removal of PICC line measures 55 cm, no free fragment seen.  The insertion
