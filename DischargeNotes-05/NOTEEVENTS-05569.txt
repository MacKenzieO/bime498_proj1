     Reason: ELEVATED LFT'S
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old woman with obesity, diabetes, ruq pain 
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      evaulate for gallstones
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Right upper quadrant pain.
     
     ABDOMEN U/S:  The liver has heterogeneous echo texture and is shrunken with a
     nodular border.  Two 4 cm masses are present in the right hepatic lobe.  Both
     masses have a hypoechoic rim with a hyperechoic center.  The main portal vein
     is thrombosed with collateral vessels around it.  There are multiple
     subcentimeter portal nodes.  The gallbladder wall is edematous, but there are
     no calculi, distention, or sonographic [**Doctor Last Name 84**] sign.  A small amount of
     ascites is present.  The head and body of the pancreas are normal.  The spleen
     is enlarged without focal lesions. The maximal measurement of the spleen is
     15.8 cm.  A 1.5 cm splenule is adjacent to the lower pole of the spleen. Both
     kidneys are normal.  The right kidney measures 10.2 cm and the left kidney
     measures 11.6 cm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1. The presence of two dominant lesions in the right hepatic lobe with main
     portal vein thrombosis in the setting of cirrhosis is highly suggestive of
     hepatoma.  However, the presence of only two dominant lesions without a
     diffuse infiltrative lesion or multifocal small lesions is not entirely
     typical of hepatoma.  The two dominant lesions also have a ""bullseye""
     appearance, which can be seen with metastatic lesions, especially those from a
     GI source. Although the appearance is most suggestive of hepatoma, metastases
     from a GI source should also be considered.
     
     2.  Splenomegaly.
     
     3.  Gallbladder wall edema is most likely secondary to the same process
     causing the ascites.  No sonographic evidence of acute cholecystitis.
     
     Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12236**] was informed by phone at 3:45 p.m.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      54 year old woman with  abn lfts
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o hepatoma
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Abnormal LFT's and abdominal pain and ascites.
     
     The patient, despite best efforts and the presence of a translator, had
     limited breath hold capacity. Therefore a combination of breath hold and non-
     breath hold strategies were used. Despite our best efforts motion artifact
     limits the quality of the study.
     
     Multiple sequences including T1, HASTE, STIR, and pre and post gadolinium fat
     saturated VIBE images were obtained.
     
     There is extensive ascites. The two dominant nodules seen in the right lobe on
     the recent ultrasound of [**3316-7-10**] are identified as areas of subtle T2
     hyperintensity relative to the background liver. These are best appreciated on
     the HASTE and STIR and to an extent out of phase T1 weighted images.
     
     Because the lesions are very subtle in contrast distinction, obtaining precise
     measurements is somewhat difficult but the largest lesion in the inferior
     portion of the right lobe is estimated to be at least 5 cm in diameter.
     
     The portal vein is not visualized on 2D time of flight sequences that are flow
     sensitive. In addition the usual flow void is not seen on HASTE sequences and
     on post gadolinium images, while assessment is limited, no flow is identified
     within the portal vein. Portions of the splenic vein are visualized.
     
     The liver has an irregular nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis and the
     spleen is enlarged measuring approximately 17 cm in craniocaudad length.
     
     No other significant abnormality is noted when allowing for the limitations of
     this study.
     
     IMPRESSION: The fact that the abnormality seen on ultrasound are only very
     subtly detected on T2 weighted images with respect to background liver, and
     there is portal vein thrombosis, strongly suggests that the lesions in the
     liver are hepatomas.
     
     Unfortunately the contrast study did not add much information to this
     diagnosis. If an ultrasound-guided biopsy cannot be performed for further
     evaluation, and if clinically indicated, a repeat non-breath hold evaluation
     can be attempted to see if further dynamic post gadolinium information can be
     obtained.

Date of Birth:   [**3262-4-10**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6712**] is a 54-year-old
Ukranian woman, mostly Russian-speaking, who has a past
medical history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and a recent
diagnosis of hepatoma with an AFP of 340,000.  She had a
recent paracentesis about one week prior to admission which
removed about 3 liters of fluid without complications.

Since then, she complains of malaise and nausea.  On the
morning of admission, she experienced seven episodes of
emesis that were nonbloody followed by two episodes of
hematemesis.  She presented to the Liver Clinic where she had
an additional episode of hematemesis.  She also noted that
she has had one week of diarrhea and melena with decreased
appetite.  She denied lightheadedness, loss of consciousness,
dizziness, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or dyspepsia.  She has not
used aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, and she
denied fevers, chills, travel history, or changes in food.
She does not drink alcohol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Schizophrenia.
4.  Hepatitis C diagnosed within the last month, complicated
by cirrhosis with ascites.
5.  Hepatoma.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Aldactone 100 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.h.s.,
moexipril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d., Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q.d., and
Prolixin 25 mg p.o. every six weeks.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN causes a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband and does not
smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6712**] was a
well-appearing woman in no acute distress.  Her blood
pressure lying down was 140/80 with a pulse of 88, upon
standing up she went to a blood pressure of 137/80 with a
pulse of 120.  Her HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Her
neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.  Her lungs
were clear.  Her heart was regular in rate and rhythm and had
a 3/6 systolic murmur loudest at the right upper sternal
border with no radiation to the neck.  Her abdomen was soft
and distended with no clear fluid wave.  Her neurologic
examination showed no asterixis.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Laboratories on admission
included a hematocrit of 33.8 which was down from 37.3 on
[**7-21**].  Her electrolytes showed a sodium of 128, a
potassium of 5.5, a chloride of 93, a bicarbonate of 23, a
BUN of 27, and a creatinine of 1.2.  Her baseline creatinine
is 0.6.  Her AST was 119.  Her ALT was 68.  Her alkaline
phosphatase was 94.  Her amylase and lipase were 26 and 45,
respectively.  Her total bilirubin was 1.8.  Her albumin
was 3.1.  Her hepatitis C virus viral load was 29,700.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room Ms. [**Known patient lastname 6712**] [**Last Name (Titles) 22**]
a nasogastric lavage of 700 cc without complete clearing.
She was immediately sent to esophagogastroduodenoscopy which
showed grade III varices in the lower third of her esophagus
with no active bleeding.  A nonbleeding varix was noted in
the cardia of her stomach as well as clotted blood in her
fundus.  She had a normal duodenum.  Therapy was undertaken
with sodium morrhuate at that time.  She was then transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was closely
watched.  She was started on Octreotide, Protonix, and
ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
prophylaxis.

Serial hematocrits were watched which were suggestive a
second bleed, so she was sent back for another
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, where upon her varices were
banded.  During her stay she received 6 units of packed red
blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.  She was also
started on Carafate after her second
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Nadolol and Imdur were begun for
her varices.  She completed three days of ciprofloxacin and
five days of Octreotide during her stay.  After her
hematocrit was stable for 12 hours she began to have her diet
advanced which she tolerated with minimal nausea.  Her
hematocrit remained stable at about 36.5 to 36.7 after her
second esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

As she had tense ascites, she underwent a large volume
therapeutic paracentesis which removed about 5 liters of
straw-colored fluid.  She tolerated the procedure without any
immediate complications.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  To follow up with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the Liver Clinic on Tuesday, [**8-11**],

     Rule out portal vein thrombosis.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3316-7-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  The liver is small and nodular in contour, with echogenic
     parenchyma consistent with cirrhosis.  A 3.8 cm hypoechoic mass is re-
     identified in the right hepatic lobe; however, direct comparison is difficult
     secondary to distortion of the hepatic parenchyma.  Echogenic material is
     identified within the right and main portal vein consistent with thrombosis,
     which is unchanged since the prior study.  There is splenic vein thrombosis.
     The intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.  Ascites and splenomegaly are re-
     identified.  The gallbladder wall is thickened with sludge.  The common duct
     is not dilated, measuring 4-5 mm.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Portal vein thrombosis, as noted on the prior study, without change.
     Splenic vein thrombosis is identified.
     2.  No change in findings consistent with cirrhosis with associated ascites
     and splenomegaly. There is at least one focal hepatic mass which is suspicious
     for hepatoma.
