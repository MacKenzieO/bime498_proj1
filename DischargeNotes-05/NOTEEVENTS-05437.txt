Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 597**] 
Chief Complaint:
RUE swelling
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
58 yo F with hx of end stage ovarian cancer reftractory to chemo 
who presents to the ED after a fall yesterday and complaints of 
right upper extremity edema. Of note, she was seen in the clinic 
on [**5-18**], where she was noted to complain of falling on occasion 
and uses a walker secondary to this instability. In additon, she 
was noted to have inadvertent removal of the J-tube a few weeks 
ago and feels her appetite is good and that she is able to keep 
small amounts of food down without nausea or vomiting. She was 
also noted to have LE edema and her lasix was increased from 
20->40 qd and was maintained on her spironolactone. She had a CT 
abd on [**2694-4-30**] showing progression of her disease in the form of 
increased ascites, new pulmonary nodule, thickening of her 
anterior peritoneum, and was noted to have elevated CA-125 of 
737 at the time of her 4th cycle of gemciabine (highest ever). 
Her oncologist has tried gemcitabine, arimidex, carboplatin and 
her tumor has progressed despite this. Patient at this visit was 
not interested in other chemotherapy agents such as taxol or 
topotecan at that time. In addition, her lasix was increased to 
40 daily from 20 daily and she was not interested in TPN. She 
began the conversation of transitioning to hospice as an option 
in the future.  
.  
ED course: Patient initially hypotensive requiring IVF, WBC 
elevated at 21.3 with 25% bands, lactate elevated at 2.8, 
unilateral RUE U/S showed occlusive thrombus in subclavian, 
axillary, brachial and basilic veins; patent vein (? collateral) 
parallel to the subclavian. Patient also hypokalemic at 2.3. She 
had a CXR showing RLL infiltrate. Pt was started on vanco/CTX 
for PNA and questionable cellulitis and given lovenox 70 mg SC x 
1.  

 
Past Medical History:
1. Metastatic Ovarian Cancer - diagnosed in [**2666**]
- s/p 6 cycles of single-[**Doctor Last Name 614**] carboplatin ending in [**8-/2692**]  
- maintenance phase of Arimidex treatment beginning in [**10/2692**]  
- SBO [**3-30**] secondary to extensive tumor and intraabdominal tumor 
fibrosis. G-tube placed for decompression and started on TPN at 
that time.  
- one dose of Doxil chemo in 07/04.  
- Pt was then hospitalized multiple times for 
bacteremia,discitis, and pneumonia amongst others.  
- Pt returned to clinic [**11-30**] to start second dose of Doxil 
however had side effects related to infusion.  
- She started gemcitabine infusions x 4, last on [**2694-3-30**].  
- A CT scan performed in April showed evidence of disease 
progression on gemcitabine.

.
Radiology:
.
[**2694-8-4**]: CXR - Compared to [**2694-1-5**], there is opacification at 
the right base, which is partially explained by elevation of the 
right hemidiaphragm, which was present previously. However, 
there may be additional pleural effusion and/or infiltrate.  
.  
[**2694-8-4**]: RUE U/S - IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus in the 
subclavian, axillary, basilic, and both brachial veins of the 
right upper extremity.
.
[**2694-8-5**]: CXR - IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to supine 
positioning. Large right pleural effusion now layering at the 
right apex and increased opacity in the left upper lung zone may 
reflect infiltrate or pulmonary edema. Good upright chest film 
is recommended.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
58yo woman with end-stage ovarian cancer refractory to 
chemotherapy that was admitted with RUE thrombus, generalized 
anasarca and possible RLL PNA. RUE ultrasound performed in the 
ER revealed occlusive thrombus in the subclavian, axillary, 
basilic, and both brachial veins of the right upper extremity. 
She was started on a heparin gtt and also vancomycin and 
ceftriaxone for coverage of a presumed RUE cellulitis as well as 
a RLL pneunomia. Prior to starting antibiotics, cultures of her 
urine, blood and sputum were obtained. Attempts were also made 
to replete her electrolytes, though repletion was difficult due 
to limited IV access (she had a L subclavian Hickman and left 
peripheral IV). On admission to the floor, she was felt to be in 
respiratory distress and she was requesting intubation. An ICU 
consult was called and the patient was found to be in moderate 
respiratory distress with an ABG of 7.46/40/51, but she was 
maintaining sats of 94% on a NRB. It was decided to transfer her 
to the ICU but en route, the patient became more hypoxic, with 
her sats dropping to 84% on NRB. In transferring patient to the 
bed in ICU, she had a respiratory arrest and became 
unresponsive. She was bagged via oropharyngeal airway until 
anesthesia arrived. It was a difficult intubation with 
esophageal intubation initially. Reintubation was successful. 
The patient was started on AC 500/14/100%/12. An ABG post 
intubation was 7.44/35/58 thus her PEEP was increased. 
Post-intubation, she became hypotensive, with BP dropping to 
80/50s and not responsive to 500 cc fluid bolus x 3. Her SBP 
continued to drop and levophed was added, but it had minimal 
effect as her BP remained in the 80s/40s. There were multiple 
attempts at A line placement for better BP monitoring and for 
access for lab draws, but all attempts were unsuccessful 
secondary to the patient's generalized anasarca and nonpalpable 
pulses. Given her acute hemodynamic decompensation, hypoxia 
despite high FiO2, and large RUE clot, the concern for an acute 
PE was significant. Cardiology was consulted, but would not do 
an urgent ECHO to evaluate for cor pulmonale.  The decision was 
made with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to hold her heparin and give TPA 100 mg 
IV over 2 hours to attempt lysis of a presumed PE to improve the 
patient's hemodynamics. Unfortunately, her hemodynamics did not 
improve, and her BP remained in the 70s-80s/20s-40s. It was 
decided that despite the patient being full code, CPR was not 
indicated. Her family was called and decided to come in to see 
the patient. On arrival, and after discussion with the ICU team, 
the family decided to make the patient CMO. She was kept on 
fentanyl and versed, but she was extubated for comfort. She 
expired several hours later, with cause of death being 
respiratory failure.
