Echo [**2834-4-21**]:
EF 70-75%, 3+TR 2+MR, 2+AR, mod AS, mod pulm HTN.

CXR [**2834-4-20**]:
1. Left internal jugular central venous catheter likely 
terminating within the brachiocephalic confluence. No definite 
pneumothorax identified; however, left apex was not included on 
current radiograph.

2. Grossly unchanged appearance to bilateral pleural effusions 
and basilar atelectasis. More dense opacity within the 
retrocardiac region also likely represents atelectasis; however, 
underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
85 F s/p recent left AKA on [**2834-3-3**], transferred from [**Hospital 67**] 
Rehab with fever and hypotension.  
  
Felt to be related to possibly multiple sources including AKA 
stump (cellulitis vs abscess vs osteo), C Diff colitis, UTI; 
also possible early pneumonia with retrocardiac opacity on CXR). 
 Pt initially covered broadly with vanco/cefepime/metronidazole 
without good effect.  Hemodynamics continued to decline as well 
as respiratory status with increasing CO2 retention despite 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.

Pressors initially started with moderate effect, however, pt's 
mental status began to decline despite improved mean arterial 
pressures.  Family meeting was held given continued decline, and 
pt was made comfort measures only by son.  Pt expired at 19:49 
[**2834-4-22**] and family was informed.  Autopsy was declined.

     FINDINGS:  Please note, the patient could not hold still for film per
     technologist.
     
     A pacemaker overlies the right perihilar region with two contiguous leads
     overlying the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Lung
     volumes are markedly diminished.  The patient's chin overlies the lung apices.
     The heart is massively enlarged but stable.  There is blunting of the right
     costophrenic angle likely due to a small effusion.  Left effusion also cannot
     be excluded.  There is retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, although an
     early developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  No definite edema is seen.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited examination due to multiple factors as above. No
     definite consolidation, although there is minimal retrocardiac opacity which
     may be atelectasis.  Right pleural effusion.  Question small pleural effusion.
     Massive but stable cardiomegaly.

     visualized lungs display no evidence of pneumothorax.  Right-sided pleural

     HISTORY:  85-year-old female with fever and hypotension.  Assess for possible
     pneumonia.
     
     Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to [**2834-3-3**].
     
     SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     There has been no change to positioning of left-sided central venous catheter,
     dense aortic calcifications, cardiomegaly, and right-sided pacemaker device.
     Combination of right-sided pleural effusion and right lower lobe opacity,
     causing obscuration of the hemidiaphragm and dense retrocardiac opacity does
     not appear significantly changed.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Slightly
     increased interstitial markings may suggest mild pulmonary edema.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1.  Unchanged probable small bilateral effusions with right lower lobe and
     retrocardiac opacity.  Differential for these opacities includes atelectasis
     versus pneumonia.
     
     2.  Mild interstitial edema

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
        85 year old woman with fever, hypotension, concern for PNA                    
       
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for interval change

     PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2834-4-22**].
     
     COMPARISON:  [**2834-4-21**].
     
     INDICATION:  Fever.  Concern for pneumonia.
     
     Left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in distal left
     brachiocephalic vein, and permanent pacemaker remains in standard position. 
     Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely stable in appearance allowing for
     patient rotation.  A large round opacity projects over the medial right lower
     lung, and is lateral to the right heart border.  There has been improved
     aeration in the left retrocardiac region attributed to improving atelectasis
     and effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is also slightly improved.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Large round opacity in right lower hemithorax medially, possibly due to a
     round area of pneumonia given the history of fever, but a discrete mass cannot
     be excluded. If this finding persists despite antibiotic therapy, dedicated
     chest CT would be advised as communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9654**] by telephone on [**4-22**], 2007, if warranted clinically.
     
     2.  Improving interstitial edema and left lower lobe atelectasis.
