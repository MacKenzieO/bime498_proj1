Admission Date:  [**3036-2-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**3036-3-28**]

Service:

Please see previous dictation for full details.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 3113**] Intensive Care
Unit for further management after the patient was started to
have fevers with rigors.  He was given Demerol on the medical
floor and then his heart rate was noted to be elevated into
the 120s to 160s.  The patient was given 5 mg of intravenous
Lopressor and Diltiazem times two with no sustained effect.
He was felt to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.  He had been
having increasing confusion on the bone marrow transplant
service and had cut his intravenous lines with some blood
dripping onto the floor.  On presentation to the MICU his
temperature was 99.6 axillary, heart rate was 166, blood
pressure 105/70, respiratory rate 14 and he was 100% on room
air.  He was placed on neutropenic precautions.  He was
confused, but equally reoriented.  He thought he was in Nadic
originally.  His HEENT was notable for oral ulcers whitish
plaques on his tongue with diffuse erythema on mucous
membranes.  Cardiovascular rapid irregular heart rate.
Respiratory examination was coarse breath sounds on left mid
lung field, decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No guarding.  No edema.  His peripheral
extremities were warm.  He had some papular erythematous rash
on his back.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Hematocrit 28.3, INR 1.2, normal
chem 7.  His T bilirubin had increased to 5.2 from 1.7.  His
direct bilirubin was up to 1.4 from 0.6.  His calcium was
8.5, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.0.  He had some blood cultures,
which were pending off a central, peripheral and Hickman
lines.  CMV viral load was negative.  His sputum culture was
notable for staph aureus 2+.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 44 year-old male with [**Location (un) 3639**]
chromosome positive ALL status post BMT [**3036-2-24**] with a
clinical course complicated by febrile neutropenia and
Mucositis with confusion associated with question of PCA
Dilaudid for pain related to mucositis with episode of rigors
prior to transfer was admitted for further observation.
Possible etiologies of his rapid atrial fibrillation included
his fevers, possible underlying lung infection,
thyrotoxicosis possibly medication related or less likely a
structure abnormalities from his Cytoxan related dilated
cardiomyopathy or Daunorubicin associated cardiac toxicity.
Though these two possibilities were considered to be much
less likely.  The patient was started on a Diltiazem drip for
management of his rapid atrial fibrillation.  His rate
control was improved significantly overnight.  A chest x-ray
was done, which showed no evidence of an acute intrapulmonary
process.  His TSH was within normal limits so this ruled out
thyrotoxicosis.  He had a cardiac echocardiogram to evaluate
his ejection fraction and possible dilated cardiomyopathy.
The echocardiogram showed mild symmetrical left ventricular
hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 55%, overall normal
function.  The left atrium was mildly dilated.  There were no
other structural abnormalities noted.  No pericardial
effusion.  It was felt that the ............ medication could
be contributing to his atrial fibrillation, however, it was
likely his acute illness.

ALL:  The patient's [**Location (un) 3639**] chromosome positive ALL was
seen as involvement.  The BMT protocol was continued
according to the BMT fellow recommendations during this
hospitalization.  The BMT fellow continued to see the
patient.  He was continued on immunosuppression for possible
graft versus host disease.  His Cyclosporin level was
monitored daily for adjustment.  Given the elevated
bilirubinemia and the faint rash on his back as well as
stomach complaints and worsening renal function, graft versus
host disease was monitored very closely.

Febrile neutropenia:  The patient was admitted on Ampicillin,
Vancomycin and Cefepime.  Clindamycin was discontinued by BMT
prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.  His blood
cultures were followed and were no growth.

Grade four mucositis:  The patient was on a Dilaudid PCA for
his grade four mucositis.  It was felt this may be
contributing to his confusion.  The Dilaudid PCA was stopped
and he was placed on morphine for pain control.  He was
continued on the bicarb mouth washes and Nystatin swish and
swallow.  The patient's grade four mucositis worsened
significantly during this hospital stay.  He became
increasingly agitated and disoriented in the Intensive Care
Unit.  On Intensive Care Unit day number three the patient
had to be emergently intubated for agitation and decreased
oxygen saturation.  It was felt the patient had some mucous
plugging, which caused him to be acutely hypoxic requiring
intubation.  He had suddenly desaturated to 70%.  His
oxygenation significantly improved after he was intubated.  A
bronchoscopy was done at the time of intubation, which showed
a mucous plug, but no other obvious abnormalities.  It was
negative for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which had been in
the differential given this patient with status post recent
bone marrow transplant.  The patient remained intubated for
seven days.  He was extubated on [**3036-3-9**] after sedation had
been appropriately weaned.  He did well after extubation with
increased ............ throughout the day.  He was slow to
begin to talk.  He did have some mild agitation, which was
treated with Haldol and morphine.  The patient was stable for
transfer to the general medical floor on [**3036-3-10**].

Acute renal failure:  During his stay in the Intensive Care
Unit the patient developed some acute renal failure.  The
Renal Service was consulted for assistance with management of
the renal failure.  The patient was transfused red blood
cells to increase his renal perfusion.  All of his
medications were renally dosed.  There was some concern that
this could be possible to a prerenal state versus
Cyclosporin or Ambazone toxicity.  His creatinine remained
stable at 1.6 throughout the remainder of his Intensive Care
Unit stay.  Renal was continuing to follow the patient on
transfer to the floor.

Mental status changes:  During the time in the Intensive Care
Unit the patient was agitated and confused prior to
intubation and after extubation was again somewhat agitated.
There was some concern it was a toxic metabolic state
secondary to steroids, Cyclosporin or central nervous system
involvement from his lymphoma.  There had been some
discussion of getting a diagnostic lumbar puncture, though
this had been done repeatedly by the bone marrow transplant
service prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit and
there was no central nervous system involvement in the
cerebral spinal fluid.  The patient was not able to tolerate
the procedure after extubation.  This was deferred until the
patient was transferred to the floor.  In addition, the
patient had to be transfused multiple bags of platelets given
that he had some thrombocytopenia from his bone marrow
suppression prior to having a lumbar puncture done.  We were
unable to obtain platelets in his Intensive Care Unit stay in
order to perform a lumbar puncture.  This should be performed
by the oncology team if this is deemed necessary.

Please see the next discharge summary addendum for the
remainder of his hospital course.

Review of systems:

Neuro:  Pt remains sedated on propofol and fentanyl, plan was to lighten sedation as toleratred for possible extubation tomorrow morning, pt became very aggitated (Inc HR, BP, and RR) with the first attempt to lower fent and prop (1 hour apart). pt is currently being slowly weaned of of fent first SLOWLY.  Currently pts Prop is @ 50 mcg/kg/min anf fentanyl is @ 30 mcg/kg/min.  Pt does not follow commands, but makes purposeful movements.  Pt withdraws to painful stim.  Pt right eye was slightly more sluggish in reaction, but now both pupils are ERRLA. pt MAE U>L.

CV: Pt bp is stable WNL per art line, currently 116/68. pt is in and out of AF throughout shift, Pt metop dose was increased and seem to be working better to control rate and rhthym, pt currently in NSR 80-90.  pt remains fluid overloaded (pittind edema in ext.)

Resp: Pt remains on vent PSV, there was attempt to wean pt today, and pt was weaned to a spont breathing trail, duril trial pt clinically looked bad( high rr 40's and aggitated) ABG was slightly worse but pt was placed back higher support settings, pt currently on PSV 8/5 40%, sao2 > 95%. pt has + BBS coarse throughout slightly decreased in right lower.  Pt requires q 4 hour sxn for small thick white blood tinge sxn.

GI/GU: pt still has small amount of liq [**Last Name (un) 976**] stool per FIB, pt has poor UO per CC. renal consult called.

     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  ALL s/p bone marrow transplant. Diffuse abdominal tenderness, likely
     CMV colitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior CT studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained with intravenous Optiray per CTE  protocol.  However,
     oral contrast was not administered secondary to the patient's inability to
     tolerate po intake or an NG tube, due to esophageal ulcers.  Coronal
     reconstructions were performed.
     
     CONTRAST: 122 cc  of intravenous Optray were administered through a right
     antecubital iv catheter. During the initial injection, a few cc's of Optiray
     squirted out between the external portion of the iv catheter and the power
     injector tubing. There was no subcutaneous infiltration of Optiray. The
     intravenous line remained patent, allowing for normal drawing back of blood
     and flushing with saline.  The power injector was reconnected to the iv
     catheter, and injection of Optiray was continued without further
     complications. The intravenous line was removed immediately after the study to
     reduce the risk of infection.  There was no adverse reaction to Optiray during
     or immediately following the study.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Several subcentimeter nodular opacities
     are present at the visualized lung bases.  The largest opacity in the right
     lower lobe measures 8 mm, and the largest opacity in the left lower lobe
     measures  5 mm.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     There is diffuse wall thickening in the proximal small bowel, with associated
     stranding and small lymph nodes in the proximal mesentery.  Both the proximal
     and distal small bowel is distended with fluid.  However, there is no wall
     thickening in the distal small bowel, including the terminal ileum.  This
     appearance is consistent with enteritis, which may be due to graft-vs-host
     disease or infection.
     
     There is a 2 mm appendicolith within the appendix.  The appendix does not
     contain any air.  It measures 8 mm in cross-section diameter at the level of
     the appendicolith, but appears smaller distal to the stone. The cecal tip
     appears mildly thickened. There is some periappendiceal stranding, which is
                                                                 (Over)

     less advanced than the stranding in the proximal small bowel mesentery. There
     is no periappendiceal free air or fluid collection. These findings are
     equivocal regarding the presence of appendicitis. There may be mild typhlitis
     at the cecal tip , consistent with graft-vs-host disease. Serial clinical
     exams are suggested. If clinically indicated, repeat imaging of the appendix
     may be helpful.
     
     The remainder of the ascending colon and the transverse colon are distended
     with fluid, without wall thickening.  The descending and sigmoid colon are
     collapsed. There is no free air or free fluid. In addition to the previously
     described proximal mesenteric stranding and small mesenteric lymph nodes,
     there is stranding and small lymph nodes in the para-aortic retroperitoneum.
     The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands and ureters
     are unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Calcifications are seen within the
     prostate gland.  The bladder, seminal vesicles and rectum are unremarkable.
     There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the
     visualized osseous structures.
     
     CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Coronal reconstructions confirm the presence of wall
     thickening in the proximal small  bowel, with adjacent mesenteric stranding.
     
     The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8087**] at 11:40 pm on [**3036-3-29**].
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     1)  Proximal enteritis, which may represent graft-vs-host disease or
     infection.

     The remainder of the ascending colon and the transverse colon are distended
     with fluid, without wall thickening.  The descending and sigmoid colon are
     collapsed. There is no free air or free fluid. In addition to the previously
     described proximal mesenteric stranding and small mesenteric lymph nodes,
     there is stranding and small lymph nodes in the para-aortic retroperitoneum.
     The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands and ureters
     are unremarkable.
     
     PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Calcifications are seen within the
     prostate gland.  The bladder, seminal vesicles and rectum are unremarkable.
     There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the
     visualized osseous structures.

     thickening in the proximal small  bowel, with adjacent mesenteric stranding.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      44 year old man with ALL s/p allo-BMT with likely cmv colitis here with new,
      diffuse abdominal tenderness.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      eval for evidence of perforation, other pathology
     No contraindications for IV contrast
     ______________________________________________________________________________
                                     FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
     HISTORY:  ALL s/p bone marrow transplant. Diffuse abdominal tenderness, likely
     CMV colitis.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior CT studies.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
     pelvis were obtained with intravenous Optiray per CTE  protocol.  However,
     oral contrast was not administered secondary to the patient's inability to
     tolerate po intake or an NG tube, due to esophageal ulcers.  Coronal
     reconstructions were performed.
     
     CONTRAST: 122 cc  of intravenous Optray were administered through a right
     antecubital iv catheter. During the initial injection, a few cc's of Optiray
     squirted out between the external portion of the iv catheter and the power
     injector tubing. There was no subcutaneous infiltration of Optiray. The
     intravenous line remained patent, allowing for normal drawing back of blood
     and flushing with saline.  The power injector was reconnected to the iv
     catheter, and injection of Optiray was continued without further
     complications. The intravenous line was removed immediately after the study to
     reduce the risk of infection.  There was no adverse reaction to Optiray during
     or immediately following the study.
     
     ABDOMEN CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Several subcentimeter nodular opacities
     are present at the visualized lung bases.  The largest opacity in the right
     lower lobe measures 8 mm, and the largest opacity in the left lower lobe
     measures  5 mm.  There are no pleural effusions.
     
     There is diffuse wall thickening in the proximal small bowel, with associated
     stranding and small lymph nodes in the proximal mesentery.  Both the proximal
     and distal small bowel is distended with fluid.  However, there is no wall
     thickening in the distal small bowel, including the terminal ileum.  This
     appearance is consistent with enteritis, which may be due to graft-vs-host
     disease or infection.
     
     There is a 2 mm appendicolith within the appendix.  The appendix does not
     contain any air.  It measures 8 mm in cross-section diameter at the level of
     the appendicolith, but appears smaller distal to the stone. The cecal tip
     appears mildly thickened. There is some periappendiceal stranding, which is
                                                                 (Over)

     History:  45-year-old man with with ALL status-post bone marrow transplant;
     now with acute abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.
     
     Technique:  Multiple axial images from the lung bases through the pubic
     symphysis were obtained following the administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  No
     oral contrast was used per ordering physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 5629**].
     
     Comparison:  Comparison was made to a prior study of [**3036-3-29**].
     
     CT of the Abdomen with IV contrast:  The lung bases are clear.  There are no
     pleural effusions.  The previously seen nodules at the lung bases are not
     visualized on the present exam.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
     unremarkable.
     
     The stomach and proximal small bowel loops are not dilated, but show mildly
     edematous walls, and a modest amount of fluid is present in the stomach.
     There is marked bowel wall thickening/edema of the mid and distal small bowel,
     and of the entire colon. This has worsened and become much more extensive in
     distribution in the interval since the prior study of [**3036-3-29**].These
     findings are consistent with severe gastroenteritis and pancolitis. Causes
     could include infectious (especially viral) agents as well as graft vs. host
     disease.
     
     Again seen is an incidental appendicolith, unchanged from [**3036-3-29**].  There
     is no free air or fluid in the abdomen.
     
     CT of the Pelvis with IV contrast:  There is a small amount of free fluid in 
     the pelvis.  There is no free air in the pelvis.  The distal ureters, bladder,
     are unremarkable.  No significantly enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes
     are seen.
     
     Bone Windows:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     Findings were communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8096**] on [**3036-8-3**] at
     approximately 5:45 PM.

     INDICATION: Abdominal pain.  CMV colitis.  History of ALL status post bone
     marrow transplant with GI graft vs host disease and diarrhea.
     
     Comparison is made to the prior examination of [**3036-8-3**].
     
     TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced images of the abdomen and pelvis following the
     administration of 150 cc of IV contrast were performed.  Images were
     reconstructed in the sagittal and coronal planes.
     
     IV CONTRAST: Nonionic IV Optiray contrast was used at the patient's request.
     
     CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The lung bases are clear.  There is a very small
     amount of perihepatic free fluid, only slightly increased from previous exam.
     The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and stomach are normal in
     appearance.  The spleen is enlarged but otherwise unremarkable. There is no
     free air.  Since the previous exam, there is marked improvement in the
     appearance of the large bowel for which no significant bowel wall thickening
     remains.  However, as noted on previous exam, there is diffuse bowel wall
     thickening of the small bowel, mostly involving the proximal and mid bowel.
     New since the prior exam is an ~ 1.5 cm peripheral hypodensity in the left
     kidney at he medial midpole.  The right kidney is normal.
     
     CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder and distal ureters are normal. Prostate
     and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  There is a minimal amount of free
     fluid.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
     
     Note is made of edema in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
     
     CORONAL AND SAGITTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS: Images reconstructed in the sagittal and
     coronal planes confirm thickening of the small bowel wall but marked improved
     appearance of the large bowel.

     pneumonia and CHF.
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST X RAY: Comparison made to study from [**3036-8-25**]. A catheter
     device is seen with the tip positioned in the distal SVC. A hazy opacity is
     noted in the left middle lung zone, which is new in comparison to the previous
     study. There is increased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which is
     likely secondary to low inspiratory lung volumes. No pleural effusions seen.
     Heart size and mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged.
     
     IMPRESSION: No evidence of CHF. A hazy opacity is noted in the left middle
     lung zone, which likely represents an infiltrate/pneumonia given the acuity of
     its appearance.

     COMMENTS:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed and compared with a
     previous study of yesterday.
     
     The tip of the new left jugular IV catheter is identified with its tip in the
     distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is seen.
     
     The lung volume is small.  There is continued mild pulmonary edema seen.  In
     addition, there are increased patchy opacities in the left lung indicating
     superimposed pneumonia.  The somewhat round appearance of the opacity in the
     left upper lobe could indicate a fungal infection, if patient is neutropenic.
     
     The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.  The Hickman catheter
     remains in place.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Continued mild pulmonary edema.  Increased pneumonia in the left
     lung, please see comment.  No pneumothorax.

Neuro: Pt is confused at times, thinking he is going home or getting oob etc. Declined pain medication throughout the day as he does not like the way it makes him feel. Did accept 4mg MSO4 IVP prior to surgeon d/c'ing port in RCW. 

Resp: Pt is on 3L via NC and satting 100%. When he removes the O2 his sats drop into the 80's. Lungs are clear and there has been no sputum to send to lab this shift. 

C/V: HR 111-146 and a fib vs sinus tach. NBP 60's to 80's. Levophed d/c'd as HR was rising, Neo hung at 0900 and now .25 mcg/kg/min, Vasopresin hung at 1200 and now .02 u/min. Goal is to keep MBP's >=60. Pt received 1 bag of platelets this AM and is due for another this evening when a port is free. Pt is receiving 4gm mag sulfate at this time for a magnesium of 1.5 this AM. 

GU/GI: Pt has condom cath which leaks at times. HO does not want to insert a foley at this time. Urine is clear yellow and a spec was sent to the lab today for urine lytes. Abd is soft with +BS and med BM today. TPN was started this evening and blood sugars Q6hr with SS reg insulin has been ordered. Blood sugar at 1800 is 167 and pt will receive 2u reg insulin sc. 

Access: Tunneled cath RCW removed this evening. A new quad lumen central line was placed in the left IJ and placement verified by X ray.

Social: Wife in for a couple of hours today. She is anxious for pt to go back to the floor. She will be in again tomorrow. Pt is full code status but wife states that she does not believe pt would want to be intubated again. Pt also stated this AM that he did not want intubation. ABG drawn by HO this AM and was lost by lab. As pt does not have an A Line another ABG has not yet been drawn. 

Plan: Titrate pressors to a MBP of 60. Monitor HR for a fib vs. sinus tachy. Monitor blood sugars and dose ins per ss. Monitor pt for incontinance and keep skin dry. Monitor old port site and new central line site for bleeding. Hang platelets when IV port becomes available after mag sulfate in.

     INDICATION: 45 y/o man with ALL and CMV enteritis, with fevers, hypotension,
     and worsened breath sounds.
     
     CHEST, PORTABLE AP: Comparison is made to prior study from [**3036-9-11**].
     There is a left internal jugular central venous line with tip at the superior
     vena cava/right atrial junction. This is unchanged in position. The
     cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Multifocal bilateral
     parenchymal opacities are present and have worsened in the left upper lobe.
     The lung volumes are low.
     
     IMPRESSION: Worsened multifocal opacities consistent with worsened pneumonia.
     Given the patient's history of ALL, an atypical infection can be considered.

     FINDINGS:  A single portable AP view of the chest shows patchy
     consolidation/collapse of bilateral upper lobes and bilateral lower lobes.
     Since the examination of [**3036-9-12**], there appears to be an increase
     in the amount of upper lobe collapse.  There is slight cardiomegaly, but
     diffuse patchy infiltrates obscure precise evaluation of the degree of cardiac
     failure.  The left-sided central venous line remains in good position.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in upper lobe infiltrates.

     verbally, rule out acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
     
     TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
     
     COMPARISONS: Head CT of [**3036-3-2**].
     
     FINDINGS: There are moderately sized bilateral low-density fluid collections
     most likely consistent with chronic subdural hematomas, which were not present
     on most recent comparison study of [**3036-3-2**]. There is symmetric local
     mass effect, with no evidence of midline shift. There is no evidence of more
     acute intracranial bleed. There are no intracranial mass lesions,
     hydrocephalus, or minor or major vasular territorial infarct. The surrounding
     soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: New bilateral low-attenuation fluid collections likely consistent
     with chronic subdural hematomas, which were not present on the previous CT
     examination of [**3036-3-2**]. No evidence of more acute intracranial bleed.
     Symmetric mass effect with no evidence of midline shift. The results of this
     CT scan were verbalized by telephone to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2171**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**3036-9-14**], at approximately 5:30 PM.
     
     
     NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: In the setting of infection, these collections
     may represent subdural effusions, which may be associated with meningitis.
     This possibility was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 11:10 am on [**3036-9-15**].
