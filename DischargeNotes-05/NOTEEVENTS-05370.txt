Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2946**] 
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, decreased po intake, nausea
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yo man with pmh sig for CAD, s/p CABG [**3365**] with 
stress imaging [**7-/3381**] with fixed reversible defect only, colon 
ca (normal scope 2002), melanoma, right middle and lower 
lobectomy of lung and radiation of lung as treatment of 
carcinoid tumor, congestive heart failure, and recent onset of 
atrial fibrillation who has had increased nausea over the past 
year with marked increase accompanied by poor po intake to only 
minimal fluids. He was scheduled for an elective cardiac 
catheterization to evaluate a cardiac etiology of his vague 
symtoms, as all other work-ups have been unremarkable. He was 
noted to have increased lethargy to the point of ""difficulty to 
arouse"" for the past few days.

On day of admission he was Seen by PCP at home who found him to 
be, oliguric & hypotensive.  Increased fluid replacement was not 
successful in increasing BP and patient was sent to ED.  On 
presentation to the ED pt is unable to answer questions other 
than ""yes/no"", but history is given by family. He denies chest 
pain, has had some shortness of breath at rest, no orthopnea or 
pnd, no dysuria, nausea but no vomitting, and no fever/chills.  
He has had over 10 pound weight loss over the past year.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 1766**] with wife.  Was a business man by trade. Has 
three daughters actively involved in his healthcare.  No alcohol 
or tobacco use.

CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, 
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or 
major vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name 264**]-white matter 
differentiation is preserved. Osseous and soft- tissue 
structures are unremarkable.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast 
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. The right atrial appendage appears to be akinetic. 
The right ventricular free wall is severely hypokinetic. The 
left ventricular functon is moderately depressed (LVEF ~30-35%) 
with global hypokinesis, inferior akinesis and inferobasal 
akinesis/dyskinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Mild-moderate ([**1-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An eccentric 
jet of mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) is seen directed toward the left 
atrial appendage. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
    Respiratory Failure: In the ER pH 7.18, CO2 98, with 
hypercarbic lethargy. After repeat ABG revealed increasing CO2, 
the patient was intubated. The suspected etiology of his 
respiratory failure was a chronic respiratory acidosis with 
superimposed acute metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure, 
causing decompensation and marked acidemia.
    A swan-ganz catheter was placed and numbers were consistent 
with hypovolemia with a small element of heart failure.  Pt 
underwent fluid resuscitation and was placed on dopamine with 
good response and improvement in renal function, and Levaquin 
was started for possible sepsis/pulm infection.  Small bump in 
CK and Troponin postulated secondary to demand ischemia. TEE 
done while intubated showed no change in cardiac function from 
previous TTE at OSH.
    On hopital day 4, it was felt that he may be volume 
overloaded after fluid resuscitation in setting of CHF with 
elevated CVP, PAPD, and also was demonstrating low SVR likely 
due to sepsis. Decreased UOP this day was thought to be due to 
low perfusion in setting of elevated preload and so he was 
placed back on renal dose dopamine and given lasix for diuresis 
until his numbers were consistent with euvolemia. He was soon 
after weaned off all pressors and extubated.  Pulmonary was 
consulted for episodes of hypercarbia during [**Doctor Last Name 314**], bipap was 
suggested but refused by patient.  The plan was to follow up 
with pulmonary as an outpatient with a formal [**Doctor Last Name 314**] study.  As 
part of the work up for increased nausea and lethargy a CT scan 
of the head was completed which was normal.

    Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had known atrial 
fibrillation but was NSR on admission, and had recently been 
started on sotalol.  He had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
with short reponse to 100J cardioversion, was started on 
amiodorone and then converted spontaneously. He was later placed 
on Metoprolol as well.

A second PA sat was sent at @0430 with results of 90.  At this point, difficulty drawing blood from swan, ? from where this result was drawn.

Resp - Remains orally intubated on AC 10/450/30%/5peep.  Bronchial bs audible, but clear.  Sx q3-4hrs for thick tan sputum via ETT.  Oral secretions are clear and copious requiring freq. sx.  ABG 7.45/42/115 after propofol 2cc bolus.  As pt is more awake and overbreathing vent, ABG 7.47/37/135

GI - OGT patent and placement was checked.  No residual as probalance absorbing at 10cc/hr.  TF dc'd at midnight, as pt is npo for ETT.
Abd is flat and bs are hypoactive.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) in as well this am and met with family and MICU team.  MICU team did not believe a trache/peg to send home on hospice was consistent w/ pt. wishes.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed to honor pt.'s wishes and helped family to consent to extubation and CMO status.  At 1300, after 0.5mg of Ativan given X 2 (over 1 hour), pt. extubated to cool neb.  Soon after extubation, it became apparent that pt. was not going to progress off the ventilator.  Pt. immediately had increased SOB, WOB and distress (progressing to hypercarbic resp. fx) with tachycardia and hypertension. Pt. given 0.5mg X4, then 1.5mg, then 2mg over the 2 hour time frame in accordance with his hyperdynamic VS and clinical picture.  Approximately, 1430, pt. continued to appear agonal yet comfortable, thus fiO2 turned down to 50% as to not prolong the inevitable.  Within 30min time frame, pt. began dropping HR to 90's (from 110-130 range) in and out of Afib, then HR dropped to 70's with pausing, MAP decreased rapidly.  Pt. breathing pattern changed as well to [**Last Name (un) **] stoking from agonal. Pt. officially passed away about 1500 with family present at bedside.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] made aware.
