Admission Date:  [**3199-7-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**3199-7-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**3117-2-10**]     Sex:  M

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease (status post percutaneous coronary intervention),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colon cancer, and
prostate cancer who presented to [**Hospital 4830**] Hospital on
[**3199-7-18**] with nausea and vomiting times three days and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 75**] for
further evaluation.

His abdomen was found to be distended.  A KUB showed dilated
loops of bowel.  The patient also had a witnessed aspiration
of feculent with subsequent desaturations to 87%.  He was
intubated for airway protection.

Once the patient was stabilized, he had an abdominal computed
tomography which showed herniation of bowel which was not
incarcerated.  Surgery was consulted and recommended the
patient go to the operating room for surgical correction;
however, the patient's family declined as they did not want
aggressive measures.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where
he remained intubated.  However, after discussions with the
family and health care proximally, the patient was made do
not resuscitate with focus on comfort care.  During a family
discussion on [**7-19**], the patient was made comfort measures
only and was subsequently extubated and started on a morphine
drip.  However, the decision was made to continue antibiotics
for the time being.  After extubation, the patient's oxygen
saturations were approximately 87% to 88%.  Therefore, he was
placed on supplemental oxygen as to prevent mild hypoxia from
causing his discomfort.  His nasogastric tube also remained
in to provide gastric decompensation and also as a comfort
measure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Physical examination on
transfer to the floor (on [**7-20**]) revealed temperature was
97.8, heart rate was 88, blood pressure was 103 to 140/33 to
47, breathing at 26 (range 17 to 26), and oxygen saturation
was 98% on nonrebreather.  Subsequently, the patient was
intubated, kyphotic, and eyes were closed.  He was not
arousable.  Cardiovascular examination revealed he had a
regular rate and rhythm.  Heart sounds were difficult to
appreciate secondary to high oxygen flow.  His lungs revealed
coarse upper airway breath sounds anteriorly.  The abdominal
examination revealed he had no bowel sounds.  The abdomen was
mildly distended and soft with two midline hernias, which
were reducible.  His extremities revealed he had 1+ radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  His extremities were
cool.  He did not clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Morphine drip.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q.24h.
3.  Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously q.8h.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After being transferred to the floor, the
patient was continued on antibiotics for approximately two
days.  He remained comfortable and on the morphine drip, and
a scopolamine patch was added to reduce airway secretions.
He also received frequent respiratory therapy and suctioning
to decrease airway secretions.  However, the patient's
respiratory and clinical status did not improve on
antibiotics.

Per a family discussion on the [**7-22**], it was agreed that
the antibiotics would be discontinued.  The patient passed
away at approximately 5:30 a.m. on [**7-23**].  The night float
intern pronounced the patient and notified both the attending
physician and the patient's family.  An autopsy was declined.
