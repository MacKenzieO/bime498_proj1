     INDICATION:  Struck by car on bicycle, evaluate for traumatic injury.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
     thighs following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     Additional coronal and sagittal reformatted images are provided.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An endotracheal tube and
     nasogastric tube are in place.  Note is made of overinflation of the
     endotracheal tube cuff with mild bowing of the tracheal wall at the level of
     the cuff. There is no mediastinal hematoma. The aorta and pulmonary arteries
     are normal in caliber and contour. The heart and pericardium appear
     unremarkable. The central airways appear patent. There is no pathologic
     appearing mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  Dependent changes are seen
     within the lower lobes bilaterally.  There is more focal consolidation and
     collapse within the right upper lobe medially.  Suggestion of interlobular
     septal thickening at the lung apices may relate to mild volume overload.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  There
     are multiple calcified gallstones within the gallbladder neck.  The
     gallbladder is nondistended.  There are symmetric nephrograms bilaterally
     without evidence of perinephric fluid collections, hydronephrosis, or masses
     in either kidney.
     
     The aorta is normal in caliber.  The celiac artery, superior mesenteric
                                                                 (Over)

     artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries appear patent.  There is thickening
     of the aortic wall and periaortic stranding within the distal aorta just
     superior to the bifurcation without evidence of extravasation of contrast.
     Delayed images obtained through the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate no change
     in the degree of periaortic stranding.
     
     There is no free intraperitoneal air.  There is no free fluid within the
     abdomen.  The large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber.  Note is made
     of mild hazy stranding surrounding a loop of sigmoid colon within the left mid
     abdomen (series 2B, image 141).  There is marked diverticulosis of the sigmoid
     colon at this location and numerous prominent lymph nodes are seen within the
     mesentery adjacent to this region.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are bilateral fat-
     containing inguinal hernias.  The bladder contains a Foley catheter and air
     consistent with Foley catheter insertion.  The prostate appears somewhat
     enlarged.  There is a right pelvic lymph node containing internal
     calcification measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter, not meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable
     within the pelvis.
     
     The visualized portion of the upper thighs demonstrate left knee joint
     effusion versus fluid within the bursa.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No fractures are identified.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformations demonstrate no
     fractures.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  No evidence of mediastinal hematoma or intrathoracic injury to the great
     vessels.
     
     2.  No evidence of solid organ injury or other traumatic injury within the
     abdomen or pelvis.
     
     3.  Periaortic stranding and small segment of aortic mural thickening within
     the abdominal aorta just superior to the bifurcation. The findings are
     nonspecific, but could represent chronic process such as aortitis or other
     inflammatory change within the retroperitoneum.
     
     3.  Stranding within the mesentery about a segment of thickened sigmoid colon
     with multiple diverticulae as well as numerous prominent lymph nodes.  The
     findings are felt unlikely to represent acute traumatic injury and could
                                                                 (Over)

      No mediastinal hematoma or pneumothorax.  Bilateral atelectasis/RUL
      atelectasis vs.  consolidation.
      
      Stranding around the infrarenal abdominal aorta with focal area of aortic
      mural thickening.
      
      Stranding around a segment of thickened sigmoid colon with diverticulosis.
      
      Left knee joint effusion.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  Struck by car on bicycle, evaluate for traumatic injury.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
     thighs following the administration of 150 cc of intravenous Optiray.
     Additional coronal and sagittal reformatted images are provided.
     
     CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An endotracheal tube and
     nasogastric tube are in place.  Note is made of overinflation of the
     endotracheal tube cuff with mild bowing of the tracheal wall at the level of
     the cuff. There is no mediastinal hematoma. The aorta and pulmonary arteries
     are normal in caliber and contour. The heart and pericardium appear
     unremarkable. The central airways appear patent. There is no pathologic
     appearing mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
     
     There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  Dependent changes are seen
     within the lower lobes bilaterally.  There is more focal consolidation and
     collapse within the right upper lobe medially.  Suggestion of interlobular
     septal thickening at the lung apices may relate to mild volume overload.
     
     The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  There
     are multiple calcified gallstones within the gallbladder neck.  The
     gallbladder is nondistended.  There are symmetric nephrograms bilaterally
     without evidence of perinephric fluid collections, hydronephrosis, or masses
     in either kidney.
     
     The aorta is normal in caliber.  The celiac artery, superior mesenteric
                                                                 (Over)

     artery, and inferior mesenteric arteries appear patent.  There is thickening
     of the aortic wall and periaortic stranding within the distal aorta just
     superior to the bifurcation without evidence of extravasation of contrast.
     Delayed images obtained through the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate no change
     in the degree of periaortic stranding.
     
     There is no free intraperitoneal air.  There is no free fluid within the
     abdomen.  The large and small bowel loops are normal in caliber.  Note is made
     of mild hazy stranding surrounding a loop of sigmoid colon within the left mid
     abdomen (series 2B, image 141).  There is marked diverticulosis of the sigmoid
     colon at this location and numerous prominent lymph nodes are seen within the
     mesentery adjacent to this region.
     
     CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are bilateral fat-
     containing inguinal hernias.  The bladder contains a Foley catheter and air
     consistent with Foley catheter insertion.  The prostate appears somewhat
     enlarged.  There is a right pelvic lymph node containing internal
     calcification measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter, not meeting criteria
     for pathologic enlargement.  The rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable
     within the pelvis.
     
     The visualized portion of the upper thighs demonstrate left knee joint
     effusion versus fluid within the bursa.
     
     BONE WINDOWS:  No fractures are identified.
     
     MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:  Coronal and sagittal reformations demonstrate no
     fractures.

     1.  No evidence of mediastinal hematoma or intrathoracic injury to the great
     vessels.
     
     2.  No evidence of solid organ injury or other traumatic injury within the
     abdomen or pelvis.
     
     3.  Periaortic stranding and small segment of aortic mural thickening within
     the abdominal aorta just superior to the bifurcation. The findings are
     nonspecific, but could represent chronic process such as aortitis or other
     inflammatory change within the retroperitoneum.
     
     3.  Stranding within the mesentery about a segment of thickened sigmoid colon
     with multiple diverticulae as well as numerous prominent lymph nodes.  The

     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained through the cervical spine without
     intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations are provided.
     
     CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  Cervical spine is imaged from C1 through the upper
     portion of T3.
     
     There is a fracture of the left occipital condyle.  The distal fragment is
     medially and slightly posteriorly displaced.  There is a small amount of
     extraaxial hemorrhage surrounding the spinal cord, but not compressing the
     thecal sac.
     
     There is multilevel degenerative change of the cervical spine, with left
     convex cervical scoliosis.  There is loss of intervertebral disc space height
     and anterior and posterior osteophytosis at multiple levels, most prominent at
     C2-3, C6-7. There is marked facet degenerative change with facet hypertrophy
     and osteophytosis as well as joint space narrowing and subchondral cysts, most
     prominent at C2-3 and C3-4 particularly on the left. At C1-2, there is
     osteophytosis superior to the anterior arch of C1.
     
     CT is limited in its ability to provide intrathecal detail.
     
     A nasogastric and endotracheal tube are in place.  The prevertebral soft
     tissues appear within normal limits.
     
     Note is made of stranding within the soft tissues of the neck posteriorly, a
     finding that could indicate edema or small amount of hemorrhage.  There are
     bilateral pulmonary parenchymal opacities at the visualized portions of the
     lung apices, and is especially thick on the left and should be compared to
     other exams.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1. Left occipital condyle fracture. There is a mild degree of associated
     extra-axial intraspinal blood, without cord compression. This was reported to

     INDICATION:  Bicycle struck by car, evaluate for intracranial injury.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are foci of
     intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right and left frontal and parietal
     lobes near the vertex, as well as within the right frontal lobe inferiorly.
     Subarachnoid blood layers within the sulci of the right and left frontal lobes
     medially bilaterally, as well as within the right parietal lobe sulci
     laterally.  There is blood within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 116**] of the right lateral
     ventricle and probably a tiny amount of blood within the left lateral
     ventricle.  There is tiny density in the interpeduncular fossa possibly
     suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
     structures.  Hypodensity surrounding the contusions within the frontal and
     parietal lobes bilaterally is consistent with edema.  There is focal narrowing
     at the location of the subarachnoid hemorrhage medially within the frontal and
     parietal lobes.  The basilar cisterns appear patent without evidence of
     herniation.
     
     There is soft tissue swelling and subcutaneous emphysema within the right
     posterior parietal scalp consistent with laceration.  There is additional
     fluid layering within the right maxillary sinus.  No fractures are identified.
     There is mucosal thickening within the ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses
     bilaterally.  The sphenoid sinuses also demonstrate mucosal thickening.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Bilateral frontal and parietal hemorrhagic contusions, and subarachnoid
     and intraventricular hemorrhage.
     
     2.  Right posterior parietal scalp laceration.  No fractures identified.
     
     3.  Fluid within the right maxillary sinus may relate to mucosal sinus
     disease.  No fractures identified.  Graph results discussed with the trauma

     HISTORY:  66-year-old man status post trauma.
     
     TRAUMA CHEST:  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  The mediastinum appears
     widened.  Opacities in the left lower lobe may represent aspiration or
     atelectasis.  There may be a small left pleural effusion.  There is no
     evidence of pneumothorax.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes appear in
     satisfactory position.  The endotracheal cuff appear slightly hyperinflated.
     No fractures are identified.
     
     TRAUMA PELVIS:  There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
     Mineralization is normal.  Calcifications in the pelvis are consistent with
     phleboliths.  Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Apparent widening of the mediastinum, which is further evaluated on CT
     (dictated separately).
     
     2.  Left lower lobe opacities, which could represent aspiration, contusion, or
     atelectasis.

     SKULL, THREE VIEWS:  There are metallic skin staples within the scalp
     posteriorly.  No definite metallic density is identified within the orbits. An
     endotracheal tube is in place and orogastric tube is in place.  The paranasal
     sinuses appear normally pneumatized.  The visualized portions of the lung
     apices demonstrate no evidence of pneumothorax.  Metallic dental hardware is
     noted.
     
     SINGLE SUPINE VIEW OF ABDOMEN:  No metallic-density foreign body is identified
     within the abdomen or pelvis.  An orogastric tube terminates in the gastric
     body.  The visualized bowel gas pattern appears unremarkable.  There are
     rounded calcifications in the pelvis consistent with phleboliths.

     COMPARISON:  [**3149-12-7**].
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.
     
     CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Again seen are multiple foci of
     hemorrhage within the parenchyma at the [**Doctor Last Name 20**]-white matter junction
     bilaterally, consistent with diffuse axonal shear injury.  These appear
     approximately unchanged in size in the interval with continued mild increase
     in surrounding edema.  There is stable subarachnoid blood layering within the
     sulci of the right and left frontal lobe near the vertex and along the falx. 
     Slight increase in subarachnoid blood within the right sylvian fissure.  A
     small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is unchanged.  Stable density
     along the tentorium likely representing small amount of layering hemorrhage.
     
     Note is made of new pneumocephalus in the interval since the previous
     examination.  There has been interval placement of a transcalvarial device
     within the right frontal region.
     
     Bone windows again demonstrate diffuse opacification of the paranasal sinuses
     with air-fluid levels.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Interval placement of right frontal transcranial device with
     pneumocephalus, new in the interval.
     
     2.  Slight increase in subarachnoid blood layering within the right sylvian
     fissure.  Otherwise stable subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally.
     
     3.  Multiple bilateral foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the [**Doctor Last Name 20**]-white
     junction, consistent with axonal shear injury, appear unchanged in size in the
     interval with possible mild increase in surrounding edema.  No evidence of
     hydrocephalus.

     upper lung represent either asymmetric edema or developing pneumonia.  Left
     lower lobe is persistently opacified and in the presence of leftward
     mediastinal shift, this is probably atelectasis.  ET tube and nasogastric tube
     are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.

     INDICATION:  66-year-old man with intracranial hemorrhage.  Assess for diffuse
     axonal injury.
     
     TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MRI including sagittal T1 and axial T2, FLAIR,
     susceptibility, and diffusion-weighted imaging.
     
     COMPARISON:  No prior MRI at [**Hospital1 1890**].  Multiple CT examinations, most recently
     dated [**3149-12-10**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are multiple areas of deep white matter hyperintensity on the
     T2-weighted and FLAIR images, most of which are associated with hemorrhagic
     blood products.  The distribution is more extensive than is visible by CT.
     In particular, involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum is evident.
     This distribution is consistent with diffuse axonal injury.  A small amount of
     subdural hemorrhage is present along the left parietal and occipital regions.
     Small amounts of subarachnoid hemorrhage are visible near the vertex, and
     small amounts of blood products layer dependently within the occipital horns
     of the lateral ventricles.  Scalp hematomas are present, larger over the right
     parietal skull than the left frontotemporal.  There is no hydrocephalus or
     midline shift.  The basal cisterns are patent.  No large vessel occlusion is
     identified.  The frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses are nearly
     completely opacified.  Small amounts of fluid are present in the bilateral
     mastoid air cells.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Diffuse axonal injury involving multiple areas in the bilateral deep white
     matter, most of which are hemorrhagic, as well as involving the corpus
     callosum.
     2.  Small left parietal and occipital subdural hemorrhage.
     3.  Small subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  66-year-old man status post head trauma requiring PICC for IV
     antibiotics and heparin infusion.
     
     PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 329**] and
     [**Name5 (PTitle) 128**].  The attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 330**] was present and supervising.  Dr.
     [**First Name (STitle) 293**] [**Name (STitle) 294**] d'Othee reviewed this case.  The patient's left upper arm was
     prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. After infusion of 1%
     lidocaine, the left basilic vein was accessed with a 21- gauge needle under
     ultrasonographic guidance.  An 018 wire was advanced into the SVC under
     flouroscopic guidance. Based on markers on the guide wire, a length of 43 cm
     was deemed appropriate for the dual lumen PICC. The PICC was cut to fit and
     advanced over the 5 French introducer sheath.  The wire and sheath were
     removed.  The line was flushed and hep locked and secured with a StatLock.
     Final chest image demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line tip in the
     distal SVC.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there are no
     immediate post-procedure complications.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of left 43 cm TOTAL length dual lumen PICC
     via basilic vein access with tip in the SVC.  The line is ready for use.

     INDICATION:  Leukocytosis.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
     
     A tracheostomy tube and left subclavian vascular catheter remain in place. 
     The left subclavian catheter remains directed towards the lateral wall of
     superior vena cava.  There has been no significant change in left retrocardiac
     opacity and small left pleural effusion.  However, there is new small right
     pleural effusion with adjacent opacities suggestive of atelectasis. 
     Previously reported interstitial edema has resolved in the interval.
     
     IMPRESSION:  
     
     1.  Bibasilar opacities, most likely due to atelectasis, although underlying
     infection is not fully excluded.
     
     2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, new on the right.

     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o hydrocephalus

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  56-year-old man with intracranial hemorrhage.  Assess for
     hydrocephalus.
     
     COMPARISON:  Head CT dated [**3149-12-13**].
     
     FINDINGS:  There are again seen multiple areas of hypoattenuation in both
     cerebral hemispheres and in the splenium of the corpus callosum.  The
     associated hyperdensities are less apparent.  These changes are consistent
     with evolution of hemorrhage.  Small hyperdensities in the dependent portions
     of both lateral ventricles have decreased in size.  However, their presence at
     this 10-day followup is concerning for fresh bleed.  The ventricles have
     increased in size since the prior study.  There may be a small low-attenuation
     left frontal subdural hematoma.  Fluid in the frontal, ethmoid and right
     maxillary sinuses has decreased, but there is still partial opacification of
     all the visualized sinuses.  There is increased opacification of the mastoid
     air cells bilaterally.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  Ventricles increased in size since [**3149-12-13**].  Small hyperdense blood within
     the dependent portions of the lateral ventricles is less than in the prior
     study but concerning for interval fresh bleeding.  Evolution of multifocal
     intraparenchymal hemorrhages/diffuse axonal injury.

     Evaluate for infiltrate.
     
     COMPARISON:  [**3149-12-19**].
     
     PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a faint airspace opacity in the right
     middle lung zone, which is new in comparison to prior study, and may represent
     aspiration or pneumonia.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, and small bilateral
     pleural effusions, greater on the left.  No pneumothorax is seen.  A left-
     sided PICC line is seen, with the tip in the upper SVC.  A tracheostomy tube
     is seen with the tip approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The pulmonary
     vasculature is stable in appearance.  Degenerative changes are seen within the
     mid thoracic spine.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are stable in
     appearance.
     
     IMPRESSION:  Faint new airspace opacity within the right mid lung zone.  As
     this is a new finding in a short time period, this is concerning for
     aspiration, though pneumonia should also be considered.  Again seen are small
     bilateral pleural effusions.
