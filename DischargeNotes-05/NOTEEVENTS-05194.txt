HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very pleasant 81 year
old white male with a history of coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft times one in [**2674**],
who has been followed by his cardiologist for heart murmur
over the past several years.  On a routine physical
examination two weeks prior to admission, echocardiogram
revealed severe mitral regurgitation with flail leaflet.  He
was referred for cardiac catheterization and then for redo
sternotomy, mitral valve replacement, with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He
was complaining of increased fatigue and shortness of breath
on exertion over a several month period.  He denied chest
pain or pressure.  Cardiac echocardiogram on [**2686-5-31**], showed
posterior mitral valve prolapse with four plus mitral
regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate
biatrial enlargement, flail mitral valve prolapse posterior
leaflet.  Cardiac catheterization on [**2686-6-7**], showed left
main 50 percent, left anterior descending coronary artery 40
percent, right coronary artery 40 percent, widely patent
functioning left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, dilated left ventricular
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 49 percent,
significant mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times one on [**2675-11-1**], with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery.

Hyperlipidemia.

Mitral regurgitation.

Diverticulitis.

Dilated cardiomyopathy.

Congestive heart failure.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

History of myocardial infarction.

Hard of hearing, left greater than right.

Prostate cancer, status post radiation treatment.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Implantation of a dual chamber
permanent pacemaker four years ago.

Coronary artery bypass graft times one in [**2674**].

Left fourth finger surgery eight years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg once daily.
2. Monopril 20 mg once daily.
3. Atenolol 25 mg once daily.
4. Zocor 10 mg once daily.
5. Multivitamin once daily.
6. Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
7. Maalox p.r.n.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed heart rate 61,
normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 98/55, height six feet
four inches tall, weight 175 pounds.  In general, an 81 year
old male in no acute distress, appearing stated age.  Skin
well hydrated, no rashes or lesions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Normal buccal mucosa.  Full upper and lower
dentures.  Neck is supple with no jugular venous distention,
question thyromegaly.  Chest clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Sternum stable.  Sternal incision is well
healed.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2,
positive III/VI murmur heard best at the apex radiating to
the left axilla.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are
warm, no edema or cyanosis, varicosities on the right thigh
and right calf with some on the left calf as well.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are grossly
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2686-6-30**], with
diagnosis of coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation,
elevated cholesterol, congestive heart failure, dilated
cardiomyopathy.  He underwent a redo sternotomy with mitral
valve replacement, number 31 porcine tissue valve, under
general anesthesia.  Operating room course was uneventful
with cardiopulmonary bypass time of 76 minutes, cross clamp
time of 48 minutes, MAP up on transfer out of the operating
room, MAP was 67 and CVP 12, PAD 17.  He was AV paced at a
rate of 88 per minute.  He was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit on a Dobutamine drip and Neo-Synephrine drip.  The
underlying heart rhythm on transfer was a complete heart
block with junctional escape beats.  He was extubated on the
evening of his operative day.  Postoperative day number one
was significant for a 16 beat run of ventricular tachycardia
treated with Lidocaine and Magnesium.  He continued to be AV
paced with an internal pacer with a rate of 87.  Both his
Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine have been weaned and his vital
signs are stable on no intravenous drip medications.  On
postoperative day number two, there were no significant
events.  The patient was seen by the electrophysiology
doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5980**] of his pacemaker which showed that
he does need a new generator but his current pacer is
appropriate with occasional AV pacing at 61 necessary.  He
was also on a small Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 for blood
pressure support which was weaned throughout the day on
postoperative day number two and off completely by
postoperative day number three.  On postoperative day number
three, the patient was transferred to the inpatient floor for
recovery in stable condition.  He continues to be AV paced at
times with an internal pacemaker with some occasional ectopy
and premature ventricular contractions.  He was followed by
physical therapy throughout his hospital course and was found
to be safe for home by physical therapy on postoperative day
number five.  On [**2686-7-5**], postoperative day number five, he
was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 24.8.  On postoperative day number six, the
patient was stable, ambulating independently in the hallways
and was discharged home with visiting nurses.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, physical examination
revealed lungs were clear.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops, occasional AV paced
with underlying sinus rhythm.  Incision is clean, dry and
intact.  Sternum is stable.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds,
positive bowel movement. Laboratories on discharge revealed
white blood cell count 4.7, hematocrit 27.9, platelet count
119,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.7, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 26, blood urea nitrogen 20, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 99.  Chest x-ray on the day of discharge shows small
bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis at bilateral
bases, no evidence of pneumothorax seen.

     CHEST, PORTABLE SUPINE RADIOGRAPH:  There is stable moderate cardiac
     enlargement.  The patient is status post median sternotomy with both CABG and
     mitral valve replacement changes.  There is some limitation of this radiograph
     due to motion artifacts.  There is patchy atelectasis in both lung bases.
     There is a small left apical and basilar pneumothorax.  The endotracheal tube
     tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube tip descends
     below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view.  The right
     internal jugular pulmonary arterial venous catheter extends into the right
     pulmonary artery.  The dual-lead pacemaker tips overlie the right atrium and
     ventricle.  There is a possible small left pleural effusion.  The osseous
     structures are unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1) Small left apical and basilar pneumothorax.
     2) Unchanged cardiomegaly with probable small left pleural effusion.

     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      81 year old man with                                                            
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o inf

                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION: Mitral valve repair.
     
     COMPARISON: [**2686-7-1**].
     
     PA & LATERAL VIEWS CHEST: The right sided dual chamber pacemaker is again
     noted with leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle. Patient is
     s/p median sternotomy, and mitral valve repair. The heart is stably enlarged.
     There has been slight interval increase in size of small bilateral pleural
     effusions. There has been interval improvement in the aeration of the left
     lung base with residual patchy atelectasis seen. Atelectatic changes are also
     noted within the right lung base. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal
     limits. The previously seen left pneumothorax is not seen on the current
     study. The lungs appear hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1) Slight interval increase in size of small bilateral pleural
     effusions.
     
     2) Improved aeration at the left lung base with continued bibasilar
     atelectatic changes.
     
     3) No appreciable pneumothorax identified.
